sions of it deal with single words and their association 
in groups.

    As far as I can discover there is no way but the 
one I have marked out which will satisfactorily deal 
with certain lines such as occur in some play of 
Shakespeare or in a poem of Marianne Moore's, let us 
say : Tomorrow will be the first of April ––

    Certainly there is an emotional content in this for 
anyone living in the northern temperate zone, but 
whether it is prose or poetry –– taken by itself –– 
who is going to say unless some mark is put on 
it by the intent conveved by the words which 
surround it ––

    Either to write or to comprehend poetry the 
words must be recognized to be moving in a direction 
separate from the jostling or lack of it which occurs 
within the piece.

    Marianne's words remain separate, each unwilling 
to group with the others except as they move in the 
one direction. This is even an important –– or amus-
ing –– character of Miss Moore's work.

    Her work puzzles me. It is not easy to quote 
convincingly.
