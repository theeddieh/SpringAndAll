The veritable night of wires and stars
the moon is in the oak tree's crotch
and sleepers in the windows cough
athwart the round and pointed leaves
and insects sting while on the grass
the whitish moonlight tearfully
assumes the attitudes of afternoon
But it is real
where peaches hang
recalling death's long promised symphony
