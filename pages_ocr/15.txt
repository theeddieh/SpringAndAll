    The imagination, freed from the handeuffs of

                        CHAPTER I

                    SAMUEL BUTLER

    The great English divine, Sam Butler, is shouting 
from a platform, warning us as we pass: There are 
two who can invent some extraordinary thing to 
one who can properly employ that which has been 
made use of before.

    Enheartened by this thought THE TRADI-
TIONALISTS OF PLAGIARISM try to get hold 
of the mob. They seize those nearest them and shout 
into their ears : Tradition ! The solidarity of life!

    The fight is on : These men who have had the 
governing of the mob through all the repetitious 
years resent the new order. Who can answer them ?

situation. If life were anything but a bird, if it were 
a man, a Greek or an Egyptian, but it is only a bird 
that has eyes and wings, a beak, talons and a cry 
that reaches to every rock's center, but without 
intelligence ? ––
