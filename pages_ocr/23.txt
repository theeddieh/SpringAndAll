                        –– 23 ––

                        V

Blacks wind from the north 
enter black hearts. Barred from 
seclusion in lilys they strike 
to destroy –– 

Beastly humanity
where the wind breaks it –– 

                    strident voices, heat
quickened, built of waves

Drunk with goats or pavements

Hate his of the night and the day 
of flowers and rocks. Nothing 
is gained by saying the night breeds 
murder –– It is the classical mistake

The day

All that enters in another person 
all grass, all blackbirds flying 
all azalia trees in flower 
salt winds ––
