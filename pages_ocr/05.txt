    Never mind ; the great event may not exist, so 
there is no need to speak further of it. Kill ! kill ! 
the English, the Irish, the French, the Germans, 
the Italians and the rest : friends or enemies, it makes 
no difference, kill them all. The bridge is to be blown 
up when all Russia is upon it. And why ?

    Because we love them –– all. That is the secret : 
a new sort of murder. We make leberwurst of them.
Bratwurst. But why, since we are ourselves doomed 
to suffer the same annihilation ?

    If I could say what is in my mind in Sanscrit or 
even Latin I would do so. But I cannot. I speak for 
the integrity of the soul and the greatness of life's 
inanity ; the formality of its boredom ; the ortho-
doxy of its stupidity. Kill ! kill ! let there be fresh
meat...

    The imagination, intoxicated by prohibitions, 
rises to drunken heights to destroy the world. Let 
it rage, let it kill. The imagination is supreme. To it 
all our works forever, from the remotest past to the 
farthest future, have been, are and will be dedicated.
To it alone we show our wit by having raised in its 
honor as monument not the least pebble. To it now 
we come to dedicate our secret project: the annihi-
lation of every human creature on the face of the 
earth. This is something never before attempted.
None to remain ; nothing but the lower vertebrates,
