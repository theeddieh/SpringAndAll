                        –– 62 ––

                XVI

O tongue 
licking
the sore on 
her netherlip

O toppled belly

O passionate cotton 
stuck with 
matted hair

elysian slobber 
from her mouth 
upon
the folded handkerchief

I can't die

–– moaned the old 
jaundiced woman 
rolling her 
saffron eyeballs

I can't die
I can't die
