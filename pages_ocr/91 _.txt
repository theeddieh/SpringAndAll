It is rightly understood when John of Gaunt's words are related not to their sense as objects adherent to his son's welfare or otherwise but as a dance over the body of his condition accurately accompanying it. By this means of the understand-ing, the play written to be understood as a play, the author and reader are liberated to pirouette with the words which have sprung from the old facts of history, reunited in present passion.
To understand the words as so liberated is to understand poetry. That they move independantly when set free is the mark of their value
Imagination is not to avoid reality, nor is it description nor an evocation of objects or situations, it is to say that poetry does not tamper with the world but moves it - It affirms reality most powerfully and therefore, since reality needs no personal support but exists free from human action, as proven by science in the indestructibility of matter and of force, it creates a new object, a play, a dance which is not a mirror up to nature but -
As birds' wings beat the solid air without which none could fly so words freed by the imagination affirm reality by their flight
Writing is likened to music. The object would be it seems to make poetry a pure art, like music.
