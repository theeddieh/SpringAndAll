In passing with my mind on nothing in the world
but the right of way I enjoy on the road by
virtue of the law
I saw
an elderly man who smiled and looked away
to the north past a house a woman in blue
who was laughing and leaning forward to look up
into the man's half averted face
and a boy of eight who was looking at the middle of
the man's belly at a watchchain
