Ho for the open country
Dont't stay shut up in hot rooms
Go to one of the Great Parks Pelham Bay for example
It's on Long Island Sound with bathing, boating tennis, baseball, golf, etc.
Acres and acres of green grass wonderful shade trees, rippling brooks
Take the Pelham Bay Park Branch of the Lexington Ave. (East Side)
Line and vou are there in a few minutes
