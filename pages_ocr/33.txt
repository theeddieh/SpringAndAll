                        –– 33 ––

at the faucet of 
June that rings
the triangle of the air

pulling at the 
anemonies in
Persephone's cow pasture –– 

When from among 
the steel rocks leaps
J. P. M.

who enjoyed 
extraordinary privileges 
among virginity

to solve the core 
of whirling flywheels 
by cutting

the Gordian knot 
with a Veronese or 
perhaps a Rubens

whose cars are about 
the finest on 
the market today –– 

And so it comes

                                3
