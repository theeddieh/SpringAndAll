Time does not move. Only ignorance and stupidity move. Intelligence (force, power) stands still with time and forces change about itself - - sifting the world for permanence, in the drift of nonentity.
Pio Baroia interested me once
Baroja leaving the medical profession, some not important inspectors work in the north of Spain, opened a bakery in Madrid.
The isolation he speaks of, as a member of the so called intellectual class, influenced him to abandon his position and engage himself, as far as possible, in the intricacies of the design patterned by the social class - - He sees no interest in isolation
These gestures are the effort for self preservation or the preservation of some quality held in high esteem
Here it seems to be that a man, starved in imagina-tion, changes his milieu so that his food may be richer - The social class, without the power of expres-sion, lives upon imaginative values.
I mean only to emphasize the split that goes down through the abstractions of art to the everyday exercises of the most primitive types
