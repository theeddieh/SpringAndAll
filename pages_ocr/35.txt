the bunch of grapes is part of the handle 
of the guitar, the mountain and sea are obviously not
" the mountain and sea ", but a picture of the 
mountain and the sea. All drawn with admirable 
simplicity and excellent design –– all a unity –– 

    This was not necessary where the subject of art 
was not " reality " but related to the " gods " –– 
by force or otherwise. There was no need of the
" illusion " in such a case since there was none 
possible where a picture or a work represented 
simply the imaginative reality which existed in the 
mind of the onlooker. No special effort was necessary 
to cleave where the cleavage already existed.

    I don't know what the Spanish see in their Velasquez 
and Goya but

    Today where everything is being brought into 
sight the realism of art has bewildered us, confused 
us and forced us to re-invent in order to retain 
that which the older generations had without that 
effort.

    Cezanne –– 

    The only realism in art is of the imagination.
It is only thus that the work escapes plagiarism 
after nature and becomes a creation
