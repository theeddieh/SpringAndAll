are not by any means the same IN INTENTION.
But then what is prose ? There is no need for it to 
approach poetry except to be weakened.

    With decent knowledge to hand we can tell what 
things are for

    I except to see values blossom. I expect to see 
prose be prose. Prose, relieved of extraneous, unre-
lated values must return to its only purpose : to clarity 
to enlighten the understanding. There is no form 
to prose but that which depends on clarity. If prose 
is not acurately adjusted to the exposition of fats 
it does not exist –– Its form is that alone. To pene-
trate everywhere with enlightenment ––

    Poetry is something quite different. Poetry has to 
do with the crystalization of the imagination –– the 
perfection of new forms as additions to nature ––
Prose may follow to enlighten but poetry ––

    Is what I have written prose ? The only answer is 
that form in prose ends with the end of that which 
is being communicated –– If the power to go on falters 
in the middle of a sentence –– that is the end of the s
entence –– Or if a new phase enters at that point it 
is only stupidity to go on.

    There is no confusion –– only difficulties.
