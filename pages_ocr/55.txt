                        –– 55 ––

Its twoinch trays 
have engineers 
that convey glue 
to airplanes

or for old ladies 
that darn socks 
paper clips
and red elastics ––

What is the end 
to insects 
that suck gummed 
labels ?

for this is eternity 
through its 
dial we discover 
transparent tissue 
on a spool

But the stars 
are round 
cardboard
with a tin edge

and a ring 
to fasten them 
to a trunk 
for the vacation ––
