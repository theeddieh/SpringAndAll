Lilacs
They stand in the doorways on the business streets with a sneer on their faces
adorned with blossoms
Out of their sweet heads dark kisses - - rough faces
The sea that encloses her young body ula lu la lu
is the sea of many arms -
The blazing secrecy of noon is undone and and and
the broken sand is the sound of love -
The flesh is firm that turns in the sea
O la la
the sea that is cold with dead mens' tears
Deeply the wooing that penetrated to the edge of the sea
returns in the plash of the waves -
