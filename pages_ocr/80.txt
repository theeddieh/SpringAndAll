80 -
whose tuneful wood and stringish undergrowth
are ghosts existing without being
save to come with juice and pulp to assuage
the hungers which the night reveals
so that now at last the truth's aglow
with devilish peace forestalling day
which dawns tomorrow
with dreadful reds
the heart to predicate with mists that loved
the ocean and the fields
Thus moonlight
is the perfect human touch
