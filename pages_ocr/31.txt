meets –– nothing –– renews 
itself in metal or porcelain –– 

whither ? It ends –– 

But if it ends 
the start is begun 
so that to engage roses 
becomes a geometry –– 

Sharper, neater, more cutting 
figured in majolica –– 
the broken plate 
glazed with a rose

Somewhere the sense makes 
copper roses 
steel roses –– 

The rose carried weight of love 
but love is at an end –– of roses

If is at the edge of the 
petal that love waits

Crisp, worked to defeal 
laboredness –– fragile 
plucked, moist, half-raised 
cold, precise, touching
