                        –– 66 ––

sent out at fifteen to work in 
some hard pressed 
house in the suburbs ––

some doctor's family, some Elsie ––
voluptuous water 
expressing with broken

brain the truth about us –– 
her great
ungainly hips and flopping breasts

addressed to cheap 
jewelry
and rich young men with fine eyes

as if the earth under our feet
were
an excrement of some sky

and we degraded prisoners 
destined
to hunger until we eat filth

while the imagination strains 
after deer
going by fields of goldenrod in
