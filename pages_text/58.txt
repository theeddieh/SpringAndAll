                        –– 58 ––

cutting my 
life with 
sleep to trim 
my hair ––

he said, we die 
every night ––

And of 
the newest 
ways to grow 
hair on

I told him 
of the quartz
lamp

and of old men 
with third 
sets of teeth 
to the cue

of an old man 
who said
at the door ––
Sunshine today !
