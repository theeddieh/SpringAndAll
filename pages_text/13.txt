                        –– 13 ––

has come upon then : rooted they 
grip down and begin to awaken

                        II

Pink confused with white 
flowers and flowers reversed 
take and spill the shaded flame 
darting it back 
into the lamp's horn

petals aslant darkened with mauve

red where in whorls
petal lays its glow upon petal 
round flamegreen throats

petals radiant with transpiercing light 
contending
                        above

the leaves
reaching up their modest green 
from the pot's rim

and there, wholly dark, the pot 
gay with rough moss.
