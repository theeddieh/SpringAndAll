                        –– 64 ––

        Nobody
        Nobody else

        but me ––
        They can't copy it

                        XVIII

The pure products of America 
go crazy ––
mountain folk from Kentucky

or the ribbed north end of
Jersey
with its isolate lakes and

valleys, its deaf-mutes, thieves 
old names 
and promiscuity between

devil-may-care men who have taken 
to railroading
out of sheer lust of adventure ––

and young slatterns, bathed 
in filth
from Monday to Saturday
