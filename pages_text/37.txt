made coins defy gravity, standing on the table as

pungency.

    But all the while the picture escaped notice –– 
partly because of the perspective. Or if noticed it 
was for the most part because one could see " the 
birds pecking at the grapes " in it.

    Meanwhile the birds were pecking at the grapes 
outside the window and in the next street Bauer-
meister Kummel was letting a gold coin slip from 
his fingers to the counting table.

    The representation was perfect, it " said some-
thing one was used to hearing " but with verve,
cleverly.

    Thus perspective and clever drawing kept the 
picture continually under cover of the " beautiful 
illusion " until today, when even Anatole France 
trips, saying: " Art –– all lies! " –– today when we 
are beginning to discover the truth that in great 
works of the imagination A CREATIVE FORCE IS 
SHOWN AT WORK MAKING OBJECTS WHICH 
ALONE COMPLETE SCIENCE AND ALLOW 
INTELLIGENCE TO SURVIVE –– his picture
