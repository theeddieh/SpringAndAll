                        –– 90 ––

It is beauty itself 
that lives

day by day in them 
idly ––

This is
the power of their faces

It is summer, it is the solstice 
the crowd is

cheering, the crowd is laughing 
in detail

permanently, seriously 
without thought

    The imagination uses the phraseology of science.
It attacks, stirs, animates, is radio-active in all that 
can be touched by action. Words occur in liberation 
by virtue of its processes.

    In description words adhere to certain objects. 
    and have the effect on the sense of oysters, or 
barnacles.

    But the imagination is wrongly understood when 
it is supposed to be a removal from reality in the 
sense of John of Gaunt's speech in Richard the 
Second : to imagine possession of that which is lost.
