                        –– 24 ––

Sold to them men knock blindly together 
splitting their heads open

That is why boxing matches and
Chinese poems are the same –– That is why
Hartley praises Miss Wirt

There is nothing in the twist 
of the wind but –– dashes of cold rain

It is one with submarine vistas 
purple and black fish turning 
among undulant seaweed –– 

Black wind, I have poured my heart out 
to you until I am sick of it –– 

Now I run my hand over you feeling 
the play of your body –– the quiver 
of its strength –– 

The grief of the bowmen of Shu 
moves nearer –– There is 
an approach with difliculty from 
the dead –– the winter casing of grief

How easy to slip
into the old mode, how hard to 
cling firmly to the advance ––
