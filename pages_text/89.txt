all the exciting detail 
of the chase

and the escape, the error 
the flash of genius ––

all to no end save beauty 
the eternal ––

to be warned against

saluted and defied –– 
It is alive, venemous

it smiles grimly 
its words cut ––

The flashy female with her 
mother, gets it ––

The Jew gets it straight –– it 
is deadly, terrifying ––

It is the Inquisition, the 
Revolution
