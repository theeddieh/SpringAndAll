SO long as the sky is recognised as an asso-
iciation

    is recognised in its function of accessory to vague 
words whose meaning it is impossible to rediscover 
    its value can be nothing but mathematical certain 
limits of gravity and density of air

    The farmer and the fisherman who read their own 
lives there have a practical corrective for –– 

    they rediscover or replace demoded meanings 
to the religious terms

Among them, without expansion of imagination, 
there is the residual contact between life and the 
imagination which is essential to freedom

    The man of imagination who turns to art for 
release and fulfilment of his baby promises contends 
with the sky through layers of demoded words and 
shapes. Demoded, not because the essential vital-
ity which begot them is laid waste –– this cannot 
be so, a young man feels, since he feels it in himself
