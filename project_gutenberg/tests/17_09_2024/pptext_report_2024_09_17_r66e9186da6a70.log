    prose : statement of facts concerning emotions, intellectua states,

    the form of poetry is related to the movements of the imagination
    the cleavage is complete
    the greatest characteristic of the present age is that it is
    there is a sharp division —— the energizing force of imagination
    the merchant, hibernating, unmagnatized —— tends to drop
    fellows that let their hair grow long   in a curve
    adorned with blossoms
    a wink over the shoulder   large as the ocean ——
    coom barrooom ——
    with green arms   to homage again the fields over

    so much depends   upon
    a red wheel   barrow

    beside the white   chickens
    nothing could be more ridiculous. To data there is no end.
    few escape whole —— slaughter. This is not civilization but
    the moon is in   the oak tree's crotch
    and sleepers in   the windows cough
    athwart the round   and pointed leaves
    and insects sting   while on the grass
    the whitish moonlight   tearfully
    assumes the attitudes   of afternoon ——
    recalling death's   long promised symphony
    whose tuneful wood   and stringish undergrowth
    are ghosts existing   without being
    save to come with juice   and pulp to assuage
    the hungers which   the night reveals
    so that now at last   the truth's aglow
    with devilish peace   forestalling day
    which dawns tomorrow   with dreadful reds
    the heart to predicate   with mists that loved
    the ocean and the fields ——   Thus moonlight
    is the perfect   human touch
    it is a wordless   world
    without personality   I do not
    seek a path   I am still with
    without being   poison ivy
    or nettle, the kiss   of oak leaves ——
    need look no further ——   I ascend
    through   a canopy of leaves
    and at the same time   I descend
    for I do nothing   unusual ——
    prehistoric caves   in the Pyrenees ——
    the cave of   Les Trois Freres
    by a spirit of uselessness   which delights them
    all the exciting detail   of the chase
    and the escape, the error   the flash of genius
    all to no end save beauty   the eternal ——
    for this   to be warned against
    saluted and defied ——   It is alive, venemous
    it smiles grimly   its words cut ——
    day by day in them   idly ——
    cheering, the crowd is laughing   in detail
    permanently, seriously   without thought
    the white daisy   is not   enough
