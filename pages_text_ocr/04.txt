from the sea on Mondays and on Saturdays —— and

all its prismatic colorings, its counterpart in our

the Russians. For the Russians we shall build a 
bridge from edge to edge of the Atlantic –– having 
first been at pains to slaughter all Canadians and 
Mexicans on this side. Then, oh then, the great feature 
will take place.
