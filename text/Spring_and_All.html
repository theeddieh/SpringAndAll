<p><span class="drop-letter">I</span>F anything of moment resulls — so much the
better. And so much the more likely will it be
that no one will want to see it.</p>
<p>    There is a constant barrier between the reader
and his consciousness of immediate contact with
the world. If there is an ocean it is here. Or rather,
the whole world is between : Yesterday, tomorrow,
Europe, Asia, Africa, — all things removed and
impossible, the tower of the church at Seville, the
Parthenon.</p>
<p>    What do they mean when they say: „ I do not
like your poems ; you have no faith whatever. You
seem neither to have suffered nor, in fact, to have
felt anything very deeply. There is nothing appealing
in what you say but on the contrary the poems are
positively repellant. They are heartless, cruel, they
make fun of humanity. What in God's name do you
mean? Are you a pagan ? Have you no tolerance
for human frailty ? Rhyme you may perhaps take
away but rythm ! why there is none in your work
whatever. Is this what you call poetry ? It is the
very antithesis of poetry. It is antipoetry. It is the
annihilation of life upon which you are bent. Poetry
that used to go hand in hand with life, poetry that
interpreted our deepest promptings, poetry that
inspired, that led us forward to new discoveries,
new depths of tolerance, new heights of exaltation.
You moderns ! it is the death of poetry that you are
accomplishing. No. I cannot understand this work.
You have not yet suffered a cruel blow from life.
When vou have suffered you will write differently ? »</p>
<p>    Perhaps this noble apostrophy means something
terrible for me, I am not certain, but for the moment
I interpret it to say : « You have robbed me. God,
I am naked. What shall I do ? » — By it they mean
that when I have suffered (provided I have not done
so as yet) I too shall run for cover ; that I too shall
seek refuge in fantasy. And mind you, I do not say
that I will not. To decorate my age.</p>
<p>    But today it is different.</p>
<p id="p2-paragraph4">    The reader knows himself as he was twenty years
ago and he has also in mind a vision of what he would
be, some day. Oh, some day! But the thing he never
knows and never dares to know is what he is at the
exact moment that he is. And this moment is the
only thing in which I am at all interested. Ergo,
who cares for anything I do? And what do I care ?</p>
<p>    I love my fellow creature. Jesus, how I love him :
endways, sideways, frontways and all the other ways
— but he doesn't exist ! Neither does she. I do, in
a bastardly sort of way.</p>
<p>    To whom then am I addressed ? To the imagination.</p>
<p>    In fact to return upon my theme for the time
nearly all writing, up to the present, if not all art,
has been especially designed to keep up the barrier
between sense and the vaporous fringe which distracts
the attention from its agonized approaches
to the moment. It has been always a search for „ the
beautiful illusion ". Very well. I am not in search of
„ the beautiful illusion ".</p>
<p>    And if when I pompously announce that I am
addressed — To the imagination — you believe that
I thus divorce myself from life and so defeat my own
end, I reply : To refine, to clarify, to intensify that
eternal moment in which we alone live there is but
a single force — the imagination. This is its book.
I myself invite you to read and to see.</p>
<p>        In the imagination, we are from henceforth (so
long as you read) locked in a fraternal embrace, the
classic caress of author and reader. We are one.
Whenever I say „ I " I mean also „ you ". And so,
together, as one, we shall begin.</p>

        <div id="chapter-19">


            <h2>CHAPTER 19</h2>

            
<p>o meager times, so fat in everything imaginable!
imagine the New World that rises to our windows
from the sea on Mondays and on Saturdays — and
on every other day of the week also. Imagine it in
all its prismatic colorings, its counterpart in our
souls — our souls that are great pianos whose strings,
of honey and of steel, the divisions of the rainbow
set twanging, loosing on the air great novels of
adventure ! Imagine the monster project of the
moment : Tomorrow we the people of the United
States are going to Europe armed to kill every man,
woman and child in the area west of the Carpathian
Mountains (also east) sparing none. Imagine the
sensation it will cause. First we shall kill them
and then they, us. But we are careful to spare the Spanish
bulls, the birds, rabbits, small deer and of course —
the Russians. For the Russians we shall build a
bridge from edge to edge of the Atlantic — having
first been at pains to slaughter all Canadians and
Mexicans on this side. Then, oh then, the great feature
will take place.</p>
<p>    Never mind ; the great event may not exist, so
there is no need to speak further of it. Kill ! kill !
the English, the Irish, the French, the Germans,
the Italians and the rest : friends or enemies, it makes
no difference, kill them all. The bridge is to be blown
up when all Russia is upon it. And why ?</p>
<p>    Because we love them — all. That is the secret :
a new sort of murder. We make leberwurst of them.
Bratwurst. But why, since we are ourselves doomed
to suffer the same annihilation ?</p>
<p>    If I could say what is in my mind in Sanscrit or
even Latin I would do so. But I cannot. I speak for
the integrity of the soul and the greatness of life's
inanity ; the formality of its boredom ; the orthodoxy
of its stupidity. Kill ! kill ! let there be fresh
meat...</p>
<p>    The imagination, intoxicated by prohibitions,
rises to drunken heights to destroy the world. Let
it rage, let it kill. The imagination is supreme. To it
all our works forever, from the remotest past to the
farthest future, have been, are and will be dedicated.
To it alone we show our wit by having raised in its
honor as monument not the least pebble. To it now
we come to dedicate our secret project: the annihilation
of every human creature on the face of the
earth. This is something never before attempted.
None to remain ; nothing but the lower vertebrates,
the mollusks, insects and plants. Then at last will
the world be made anew. Houses crumble to ruin,
cities disappear giving place to mounds of soil blown
thither by the winds, small bushes and grass give way
to trees which grow old and are succeeded by other
trees for countless generations. A marvellous serenity
broken only by bird and wild beast calls reigns over
the entire sphere. Order and peace abound.</p>
<p>    This final and self inflicted holocaust has been
all for love, for sweetest love, that together the human
race, yellow, black, brown, red and white, agglutinated
into one enormous soul may be gratified with the
sight and retire to the heaven of heavens content to
rest on its laurels. There, soul of souls, watching its
own horrid unity, it boils and digests itself within
the tissues of the great Being of Eternity that we
shall then have become. With what magnificent
explosions and odors will not the day be accomplished
as we, the Great One among all creatures, shall
go about contemplating our self-prohibited desires
as we promenade them before the inward review
of our own bowels — et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...
and it is spring — both in Latin and Turkish, in
English and Dutch, in Japanese and Italian ; it is
spring by Stinking River where a magnolia tree,
without leaves, before what was once a farmhouse,
now a ramshackle home for millworkers, raises its
straggling branches of ivorywhite flowers.</p>

        <div id="chapter-xiii">

            <h2 class="upside-down"> CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Thus, weary of life, in view of the great consummation
which awaits us — tomorrow, we rush among
our friends congratulating ourselves upon the joy
soon to be. Thoughtless of evil we crush out the
marrow of those about us with our heavy cars as
we go happily from place to place. It seems that
there is not time enough in which to speak the full
of our exaltation. Only a day is left, one miserable
day, before the world comes into its own. Let us
hurry ! Why bother for this man or that ? In the
offices of the great newspapers a mad joy reigns as
they prepare the final extras. Rushing about, men
bump each other into the whirring presses. How
funny it seems. All thought of misery has left us.
Why should we care? Children laughingly fling
themselves under the wheels of the street cars,
airplanes crash gaily to the earth. Someone has
written a poem.</p>
<p>    Oh life, bizarre fowl, what color are your wings?
Green, blue, red, yellow, purple, white, brown,
orange, black, grey? In the imagination, flying
above the wreck of ten thousand million souls, I see
you departing sadly for the land of plants and insects,
already far out to sea. (Thank you, I know well what
I am plagiarising) Your great wings flap as you
disappear in the distance over the pre-Columbian
acres of floating weed.</p>
<p>    The new cathedral overlooking the park, looked
down from its towers today, with great eyes, and
saw by the decorative lake a group of people staring
curiously at the corpse of a suicide : Peaceful, dead
young man, the money they have put into the stones
has been spent to teach men of life's austerity. You
died and teach us the same lesson. You seem a
cathedral, celebrant of the spring which shivers for
me among the long black trees.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="chapter-vi">

            <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>    Now, in the imagination, all flesh, all human
flesh has been dead upon the earth for ten million,
billion years. The bird has turned into a stone within
whose heart an egg, unlayed, remained hidden.</p>
<p>    It is spring ! but miracle of miracles a miraculous
miracle has gradually taken place during these
seemingly wasted eons. Through the orderly sequences
of unmentionable time EVOLUTION HAS
REPEATED ITSELF FROM THE BEGINNING.</p>
<p>    Good God!</p>
<p>    Every step once taken in the first advance of the
human race, from the amoeba to the highest type
of intelligence, has been duplicated, every step
exactly paralleling the one that preceded in the
dead ages gone by. A perfect plagiarism results.
Everything is and is new. Only the imagination is
undeceived.</p>
<p>    At this point the entire complicated and laborious
process begins to near a new day. (More of this in
<a href="#chapter-xix">Chapter XIX</a>) But for the moment everything is
fresh, perfect, recreated.</p>
<p>    In fact now, for the first time, everything IS new.
Now at last the perfect effect is being witlessly discovered.
The terms „ veracity " „ actuality " „ real "
„ natural " „ sincere " are being discussed at length,
every word in the discussion being evolved from an
identical discussion which took place the day before
yesterday.</p>
<p>    Yes, the imagination, drunk with prohibitions,
has destroyed and recreated everything afresh in
the likeness of that which it was. Now indeed men
look about in amazement at each other with a full
realization of the meaning of „ art ".</p>
        </div>

        <div id="chapter-2">

            <h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>


<p>    It is spring: life again begins to assume its normal
appearence as of „ today ". Only the imagination
is undeceived. The volcanos are extinct. Coal is
beginning to be dug again where the fern forests
stood last night. (If an error is noted here, pay no
attention to it).</p>
        </div>

        <div id="chapter-xix">

            <h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>    I realize that the chapters are rather quick in their
sequence and that nothing much is contained in any
one of them but no one should be surprised at this
today.</p>

            <h3>THE TRADITIONALISTS OF PLAGIARISM</h3>

<p>    It is spring. That is to say, it is approaching THE
BEGINNING.</p>
<p>    In that huge and microscopic career of time, as it
were a wild horse racing in an illimitable pampa
under the stars, describing immense and microscopic
circles with his hoofs on the solid turf, running
without a stop for the millionth part of a second
until he is aged and worn to a heap of skin, bones
and ragged hoofs — In that majestic progress of life,
that gives the exact impression of Phidias' frizze,
the men and beasts of which, though they seem of
the rigidity of marble are not so but move, with
blinding rapidity, though we do not have the time
to notice it, their legs advancing a millionth part
of an inch every fifty thousand years — In that
progress of life which seems stillness itself in the mass
of its movements — at last SPRING is approaching.</p>
<p>    In that colossal surge toward the finite and the
capable life has now arrived for the second time at
that exact moment when in the ages past the destruction
of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> occured.</p>
<p>    Now at last that process of miraculous verisimilitude,
that grate copying which evolution has
followed, repeating move for move every move that
it made in the past — is approaching the end.</p>
<p>    Suddenly it is at an end. THE WORLD IS NEW.</p>

    under the surge of the blue
    mottled clouds driven from the

    waste of broad, muddy fields
    brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen

    patches of standing water
    the scattering of tall trees

    All along the road the reddish
    purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy
    stuff of bushes and small trees
    with dead, brown leaves under them
    leafless vines —

    Lifeless in appearance, sluggish
    dazed spring approaches —

    They enter the new world naked,
    cold, uncertain of all
    save that they enter. All about them
    the cold, familiar wind —

    Now the grass, tomorrow
    the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf

    One by one objects are defined —
    It quickens : clarity, outline of leaf

    But now the stark dignity of
    entrance — Still, the profound change
    has come upon then : rooted they
    grip down and begin to awaken

    Pink confused with white
    flowers and flowers reversed

    darting it back
    into the lamp's horn

    red where in whorls
    petal lays its glow upon petal
    round flamegreen throats

    petals radiant with transpiercing light
    contending
                            above

    the leaves
    reaching up their modest green

    and there, wholly dark, the pot
    gay with rough moss.
</pre>

<p>    A terrific confusion has taken place. No man knows
whither to turn. There is nothing ! Emptiness stares
us once more in the face. Whither ? To what end ?
Each asks the other. Has life its tail in its mouth or
its mouth in its tail ? Why are we here ? Dora
Marsden's philosophic algebra. Everywhere men look
into each other's faces and ask the old unanswerable
question : Whither ? How ? What ? Why ?</p>
<p>    At any rate, now at last spring is here !</p>
<p>    The rock has split, the egg has hatched, the prismatically
plumed bird of life has escaped from its
cage. It spreads its wings and is perched now on
the peak of the huge African mountain Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>    Strange recompense, in the depths of our despair
at the unfathomable mist into which all mankind is
plunging, a curious force awakens. It is HOPE long
asleep, aroused once more. Wilson has taken an army
of advisers and sailed for England. The ship has
sunk. But the men are all good swimmers. They take
the women on their shoulders and buoyed on by the
inspiration of the moment they churn the free seas
with their sinewey arms, like Ulysses, landing all
along the European seaboard.</p>
<p>    Yes, hope has awakened once more in men's
    hearts. It is the NEW ! Let us go forward !</p>
<p>    The imagination, freed from the handeuffs of
„ art ", takes the lead ! Her feet are bare and not
too delicate. In fact those who come behind her have
much to think of. Hm. Let it pass.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="chapter-i">

            <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

            <h3>SAMUEL BUTLER</h3>

<p>    The great English divine, Sam Butler, is shouting
from a platform, warning us as we pass: There are
two who can invent some extraordinary thing to
one who can properly employ that which has been
made use of before.</p>
<p>    Enheartened by this thought THE
TRADITIONALISTS OF PLAGIARISM try to get hold
of the mob. They seize those nearest them and shout
into their ears : Tradition ! The solidarity of life!</p>
<p>    The fight is on : These men who have had the
governing of the mob through all the repetitious
years resent the new order. Who can answer them ?
One perhaps here and there but it is an impossible
situation. If life were anything but a bird, if it were
a man, a Greek or an Egyptian, but it is only a bird
that has eyes and wings, a beak, talons and a cry
that reaches to every rock's center, but without
intelligence ? —</p>
<p>    The voice of the Delphic Oracle itself, what was
it ? A poisonous gas from a rock's cleft.</p>
<p>    Those who led yesterday wish to hold their sway
a while longer. It is not difficult to understand their
mood. They have their great weapons to hand :
„ science ", „ philosophy " and most dangerous of
all „ art".</p>
<p>    Meanwhile, SPRING, which has been approaching
for several pages, is at last here.</p>
<p>    — they ask us to return to the proven truths of
tradition, even to the twice proven, the substantiality
of which is known. Demuth and a few others
do their best to point out the error, telling us that
design is a function of the IMAGINATION, describing
its movements, its colors — but it is a hard battle.
I myself seek to enter the lists with these few notes
jolted down in the midst of the action, under distracting
circumstances — to remind myself (see <a href="#p2-paragraph4">p. 2,
paragraph 4</a>) of the truth</p>

<p>    Bare handed the man contends with the sky,
without experience of existence seeking to invent
and design</p>
<p>    Crude svmbolism is to associate emotions
with natural phenomena such as anger with lightning,
flowers with love it goes further and associates
certain textures with</p>
<p>    Such work is empty. It is very typical of almost
all that is done by the writers who fill the pages
every month of such a paper as. Everything that I
have done in the past — except those parts which
may be called excellent — by chance, have that quality
about them.</p>
<p>    It is typified by use of the word « like » or that
« evocation » of the « image » which served us for a
time. Its abuse is apparent. The insignificant « image »
may be « evoked » never so ably and still mean
nothing.</p>
<p>    With all his faults Alfred Kreymborg never did
this. That is why his work — escaping a common
fault — still has value and will tomorrow have more.</p>
<p>    Sandburg, when uninspired by intimacies of the
eye and ear, runs into this empty symbolism. Such
poets of promise as ruin themselves with it, though
many have major sentimental faults besides.</p>
<p>    Marianne Moore escapes. The incomprehensibility
of her poems is witness to at what cost (she cleaves
herself away) as it is also to the distance which the
most are from a comprehension of the purpose of
composition.</p>
<p>    The better work men do is always done under
stress and at great personal cost.</p>
<p>    It is no different from the aristocratic compositions
of the earlier times, The Homeric inventions
                                                but
these occured in different times, to this extent, that
life had not yed sieved through its own multiformity.
That aside, the work the two-thousand-year-old poet
did and that we do are one piece. That is the vitality
of the classics.</p>
<p>    So then — Nothing is put down in the present book
—except through weakness of the imagination —
which is not intended as of a piece with the « nature »
which Shakespeare mentions and which Hartley
speaks of so completely in his « Adventures » : it is
the common thing which is anonymously about us.</p>
<p>    Composition is in no essential an escape from life.
In fact if it is so it is negligeable to the point of
insignificance. Whatever « life » the artist may be forced
to lead has no relation to the vitality of his compositions.
Such names as Homer, the blind ; Scheherazade,
who lived under threat — Their compositions
have as their excellence an identity with life since
they are as actual, as sappy as the leaf of the tree
which never moves from one spot.</p>
<p>    What I put down of value will have this value :
an escape from crude symbolism, the annihilation
of strained associations, complicated ritualistic forms
designed to separate the work from « reality » — such
as rhyme, meter as meter and not as the essential of
the work, one of its words.</p>
<p>    But this smacks too much of the nature of — This
is all negative and appears to be boastful. It is not
intended to be so. Rather the opposite</p>
<p>    The work will be in the realm of the imagination
as plain as the sky is to a fisherman — A very clouded
sentence. The word must be put down for itself, not
as a symbol of nature but a part, cognisant of the
whole — aware — civilized.</p>

<p>    The inevitable flux of the seeing eye toward measuring
itself by the world it inhabits can only result
in himself crushing humiliation unless the individual
raise to some approximate co-extension with the
universe. This is possible by aid of the imagination.
Only through the ageney of this force can a man feel
himself moved largely with sympathetic pulses at
work —</p>
<p>    A work of the imagination which fails to release
the senses in accordance with this major requisite —
the sympathies, the intelligence in its selective world,
fails at the elucidation, the alleviation which is —
    In the composition, the artist does exactly what
every eye must do with life, fix the particular with
the universality of his own personality — Taught by
the largeness of his imagination to feel every form
which he sees moving within himself, he must prove
the truth of this by expression.</p>
<p>    The contraction which is felt.</p>
<p>    All this being anterior to technique, that can have
only a sequent value ; but since all that appears to
the senses on a work of art does so through
                                       fixation by
the imagination of the external as well internal means
of expression the essential nature of technique or
transcription.</p>
<p>    Only when this position is reached can life proper
be said to begin since only then ean a value be affixed
to the forms and activities of which it consists.</p>
<p>    Only then can the sense of frustration which ends.
All composition defeated.</p>
<p>    Only through the imagination is the advance of
intelligence possible, to keep beside growing understanding.</p>
<p>    Complete lack of imagination would be the same
at the cost of intelligence, complete.</p>
<p>    Even the most robust constitution has its limits,
though the Roman feast with its reliance upon regurgitation
to prolong it shows an active ingenuity, yet
the powers of a man are so pitifully small, with the
ocean to swallow — that at the end of the feast
nothing would be left but suicide.</p>
<p>    That or the imagination which in this ease takes
the form of humor, is known in that form — the
release from physical necessity. Having eaten to the
full we must acknowledge our insufficiency since we
have not annihilated all food nor even the quantity
of a good sized steer. However we have annihilated
all eating : quite plainly we have no more appetite.
This is to say that the imagination has removed us
from the banal necessity of bursting ourselves — by
acknowledging a new siluation. We must acknowledge
that the ocean we would drink is too vast — but at
the same time we realize that extension in our case
is not confined to the intestine only. The stomach
is full, the ocean no fuller, both have the same qua=
lity of fullness. In that, then, one is equal to the
other. Having eaten, the man has released his mind.</p>
<p>    THIS catalogue might be increased to larger proportions
without stimulating the sense.</p>
<p>    In works of the imagination that which is taken
for great good sense, so that it seems as if an accurate
precept were discovered, is in reality not so, but
vigor and accuracy of the imagination alone. In work
such as Shakespeares —</p>
<p>    This leads to the discovery that has been made
today — old catalogues aside — full of meat —</p>
<p>    " the divine illusion has about it that inaccuracy
which reveals that which I mean ".</p>
<p>    There is only „ illusion " in art where ignorance
of the bystander confuses imagination and its works
with cruder processes. Truly men feel an enlargement
before great or good work, an expansion but
this is not, as so many believe today a „ lie ", a
stupefaction, a kind of mesmerism, a thing to block
out " life ", bitter to the individual, by a " vision
of beauty ". It is a work of the imagination. It
gives the feeling of completion by revealing the
oneness of experience ; it rouses rather than stupefies
the intelligence by demonstrating the importance
of personality, by showing the individual, depressed
before it, that his life is valuable — when completed
by the imagination. And then only. Such work
elucidates —</p>
<p>    Such a realization shows us the falseness of
allempling to " copy " nature. The thing is equally
silly when we try to " make " pictures —</p>
<p>    But such a picture as that of Juan Gris, though
I have not seen it in color, is important as marking
more clearly than any I have seen what the modern
trend is : the attempt is being made to separate
things of the imagination from life, and obviously,
by using the forms common to experience so as
not to frighten the onlooker away but to invite
him,</p>

<p>    things with which he is familiar, simple things
— at the same time to detach them from ordinary
experience to the imagination. Thus they are still
" real " they are the same things they would be
it photographed or painted by Monet, they
are recognizable as the things touched by the hands
during the day, but in this painting they are seen
to be in some peculiar way — detached</p>
<p>    Here is a shutter, a bunch of grapes, a sheet of
music, a picture of sea and mountains (particularly
fine) which the onlooker is not for a moment permitted
to witness as an " illusion ". One thing laps over
on the other, the cloud laps over on the shutter,
the bunch of grapes is part of the handle
of the guitar, the mountain and sea are obviously not
" the mountain and sea ", but a picture of the
mountain and the sea. All drawn with admirable
simplicity and excellent design — all a unity —</p>
<p>    This was not necessary where the subject of art
was not " reality " but related to the " gods " —
by force or otherwise. There was no need of the
" illusion " in such a case since there was none
possible where a picture or a work represented
simply the imaginative reality which existed in the
mind of the onlooker. No special effort was necessary
to cleave where the cleavage already existed.</p>
<p>    I don't know what the Spanish see in their Velasquez
and Goya but</p>
<p>    Today where everything is being brought into
sight the realism of art has bewildered us, confused
us and forced us to re-invent in order to retain
that which the older generations had without that
effort.</p>
<p>    Cezanne —</p>
<p>    The only realism in art is of the imagination.
It is only thus that the work escapes plagiarism
after nature and becomes a creation</p>
<p>    Invention of new forms to embody this reality
of art, the one thing which art is, must occupy all
serious minds concerned.</p>
<p>    From the time of Poe in the U. S. — the first
American poet had to be a man of great separation —
with close identity with life. Poe could not have
written a word without the violence of expulsive
emotion combined with the in-driving force of a
crudely repressive environment. Between the two
his imagination was forced into being to keep him
to that reality, completeness, sense of escape which
is felt in his work — his topics. Typically American
— accurately, even inevitably set in his time.</p>
<p>    So, after this tedious diversion — whatever of
dull you find among my work, put it down to criticism,
not to poetry. You will not be mistaken —
Who am I but my own critic? Surely in isolation
one becomes a god — At least one becomes something
of everything, which is not wholly godlike, yet a
little so — in many things.</p>
<p>    It is not necessary to count every flake of the
truth that falls ; it is necessary to dwell in the
imagination if the truth is to be numbered. It is
necessary to speak from the imagination —</p>
<p>    The great furor about perspective in Holbein's
day had as a consequence much fine drawing, it
made coins defy gravity, standing on the table as
if in the act of falling. To say this was lifelike must
have been satisfying to the master, it gave depth,
pungency.</p>
<p>    But all the while the picture escaped notice —
partly because of the perspective. Or if noticed it
was for the most part because one could see " the
birds pecking at the grapes " in it.</p>
<p>    Meanwhile the birds were pecking at the grapes
outside the window and in the next street Bauermeister
Kummel was letting a gold coin slip from
his fingers to the counting table.</p>
<p>    The representation was perfect, it " said something
one was used to hearing " but with verve,
cleverly.</p>
<p>    Thus perspective and clever drawing kept the
picture continually under cover of the " beautiful
illusion " until today, when even Anatole France
trips, saying: " Art — all lies! " — today when we
are beginning to discover the truth that in great
works of the imagination A CREATIVE FORCE IS
SHOWN AT WORK MAKING OBJECTS WHICH
ALONE COMPLETE SCIENCE AND ALLOW
INTELLIGENCE TO SURVIVE — his picture
lives anew. It lives as pictures only can : by their
power TO ESCAPE ILLUSION and stand between
man and nature as saints once stood between man
and the sky — their reality in such work, say, as
that of Juan Gris</p>
<p>    No man could suffer the fragmentary nature of
his understanding of his own life —</p>
<p>    Whitman's proposals are of the same piece with the
modern trend toward imaginative understanding of
life. The largeness which he interprets as his identity
with the least and the greatest about him, his " democracy "
represents the vigor of his imaginative
life.</p>

<p>    Understood in a practical way, without calling
upon mystic agencies, of this or that order, it is that
life becomes actual only when it is identified with
ourselves. When we name it, life exists. To repeat
physical experiences has no —</p>
<p>    The only means he has to give value to life is to
recognise it with the imagination and name it ; this is
so. To repeat and repeat the thing without naming
it is only to dull the sense and results in frustration.</p>
<p>this make the artist the prey of life. He is easy of
attack.</p>
<p>    I think often of my earlier work and what it has cost
me not to have been clear. I acknowledge I have
moved chaotically about refusing or rejecting most
things, seldom accepting values or acknowledging
anything.</p>
<p>                because I early recognised the
futility of acquisitive understanding and at the same
time rejected religious dogmatism. My whole life has
been spent (so far) in seeking to place a value upon
experience and the objects of experience that would
satisfy my sense of inclusiveness without redundancy
— completeness, lack of frustration with the liberty
of choice; the things which the pursuit of « art »
offers —</p>
<p>    But though I have felt « free » only in the presence
of works of the imagination, knowing the quickening
of the sense which came of it, and though this experience
has held me firm at such times, yet being of a
slow but accurate understanding, I have not always
been able to complete the intellectual steps which
would make me firm in the position.</p>
<p>    So most of my life has been lived in hell — a hell
of repression lit by flashes of inspiration, when a
poem such as this or that would appear</p>
<p>    What would have happened in a world similarly
lit by the imagination</p>
<p>    Oh yes, you are a writter ! a phrase that has often
damned me, to myself. I rejected it with heat but
the stigma remained. Not a man, not an understanding
but a WRITER. I was unable to recognize.</p>
<p>    I do not forget with what heat too I condemned
some poems of some contemporary praised because
of their loveliness —</p>
<p>I find that I was somewhat mistaken — ungenerous</p>
<p>    Life's processes are very simple. One or two moves
are made and that is the end. The rest is repetitious.</p>
<p>    The Improvisations — coming at a time when I
was trying to remain firm at great cost — I had
recourse to the expedient of letting life go completely
in order to live in the world of my choice.</p>
<p>                            I let the imagination have its
own way to see if it could save itself. Something
very definite came of it. I found myself alleviated but
most important I began there and then to revalue
experience, to understand what I was at —</p>
<p>    The virtue of the improvisations is their placement
in a world of new values —</p>
<p>                their fault is their dislocation of
sense, often complete. But it is the best I could do
under the circumstances. It was the best I could
do and retain any value to experience at all.</p>
<p>    Now I have come to a different condition. I find
that the values there discovered can be extended. I
find myself extending the understanding to the work
of others and to other things —</p>
<p>            I find that there is work to be done in the
creation of new forms, new names for experience</p>
<p>    and that « beauty » is related not to « loveliness »
but to a state in which reality playes a part</p>
<p>    Such painting as that of Juan Gris, coming after
the impressionists, the expressionists, Cezanne —
and dealing severe strokes as well to the expressionits
as to the impressionists group — points forward
to what will prove the greatest painting yet produced.</p>
<p>    — the illusion once dispensed with, painting has
this problem before it : to replace not the forms but
the reality of experience with its own —</p>
<p>    up to now shapes and meanings but always the
illusion relving on composition to give likeness to
« nature »</p>
<p>    now works of art cannot be left in this category of
France's « lie », they must be real, not « realism » but
reality itself —</p>
<p>    they must give not the sense of frustration but a
sense of completion, of actuality — It is not a matter
of « representation » — much may be represented
actually, but of separate existence.</p>
<p>    enlargement — revivification of values,</p>

<p>    Writing is not a searching about in the daily
experience for apt similies and pretty thoughts and
images. I have experienced that to my sorrow. It
is not a conscious recording of the day's experiences
" freshly and with the appearance of reality " —
This sort of thing is seriously to the development
of any ability in a man, it fastens him down, makes
him a — It destroys, makes nature an accessory to
the particular theory he is following, it blinds him
to his world, —</p>
<p>    The writer of imagination would find himself
released from observing things for the purpose of
writing them down later. He would be there to
enjoy, to taste, to engage the free world, not a
world which he carries like a bag of food, always
fearful lest he drop something or someone get more
than he,</p>
<p>    A world detached from the necessity of recording
it, sufficient to itself, removed from him (as it
most certainly is) with which he has bitter and
delicious relations and from which he is independant
— moving at will from one thing to another — as
he pleases, unbound — complete</p>
<p>    and the unique proof of this is the work of the
imagination not " like " anything but transfused
with the same forces which transfuse the earth —
at least one small part of them.</p>
<p>    Nature is the hint to composition not because it
is familiar to us and therefore the terms we apply
to it have a least common denominator quality
which gives them currency — but because it possesses
the quality of independant existance, of reality
which we feel in ourselves. It is not opposed to art
but apposed to it.</p>
<p>    I suppose Shakespeare's familiar aphorism about
holding the mirror up to nature has done more
harm in stabilizing the copyist tendency of the arts
among us than —</p>
<p>    the mistake in it (though we forget that it is not
S. speaking but an imaginative character of his)
is to have believed that the reflection of nature is
nature. It is not. It is only a sham nature, a " lie ".</p>
<p>    Of course S. is the most conspicuous example
desirable of the falseness of this very thing.</p>
<p>    He holds no mirror up to nature but with his
imagination rivals nature's composition with his
own.</p>
<p>    He himself become " nature " — continuing
" its " marvels — if you will</p>
<p>    I am often diverted with a recital which I have
made for myself concerning Shakespeare : he was
a comparatively uninformed man, quite according
to the orthodox tradition, who lived from first to
last a life of amusing regularity and simplicity, a
house and wife in the suburbs, delightful children,
a girl at court (whom he really never confused with
his writing) and a café life which gave him with
the freshness of discovery, the information upon which
his imagination fed. London was full of the concentrates
of science and adventure. He saw at " The
Mermaid " everything he knew. He was not conspicuous
there except for his spirits.</p>
<p>    His form was presented to him by Marlow, his
stories were the common talk of his associates or
else some compiler set them before him. His types
were particularly quickened with life about him.</p>
<p>    Feeling the force of life, in his peculiar intelligence,
the great dome of his head, he had no need of anything
but writing material to relieve himself of his
thoughts. His very lack of scientific training loosened
his power. He was unencumbered.</p>
<p>    For S. to pretend to knowledge would have been
ridiculous — no escape there — but that he possessed
knowledge, and extraordinary knowledge, of the
affairs which concerned him, as they concerned the
others about him, was self-apparent to him. It was
not apparent to the others.</p>
<p>    His actual power was PURELY of the imagination.
Not permitted to speak as W.S., in fact peculiarly
barred from speaking so because of his lack
of information, learning, not being able to rival his
fellows in scientific training or adventure and at the
" same time being keen enough, imaginative enough,
to know that there is no escape except in perfection,
in excellence, in technical excellence — his buoyancy
of imagination raised him NOT TO COPY them,
not to holding the mirror up to them but to equal, to
surpass them as a creator of knowledge, as a vigorous,
living force above their heads.</p>
<p>    His escape was not simulated but real. Hamlet
no doubt was written about at the middle of his life.</p>
<p>    He speaks authoritatively through invention,
through characters, through design. The objects
of his world were real to him because he could use
them and use them with understanding to make his
inventions —</p>
<p>    The imagination is a —</p>
<p>    The vermiculations of modern criticism of S. particularly
amuse when the attempt is made to force
the role of a Solon upon the creator of Richard 3d.</p>
<p>    So I come again to my present day gyrations.</p>
<p>    So it is with the other classics : their meaning and
worth can only be studied and understood in the
imagination — that which begot them only can give
them life again, re-enkindle their perfection —</p>
<p>    useless to study by rote or scientific research —
Useful for certain understanding to corroborate the
imagination —</p>
<p>    Yes, Anatole was a fool when he said: It is a lie. —
That is it. If the actor simulates life it <i>is</i> a lie. But
— but why continue without an audience ?</p>
<p>    The reason people marvel at works of art and say :
How in Christ's name did he do it ? — is that they
know nothing of the physiology of the nervous system
and have never in their experience witnessed the
larger processes of the imagination.</p>
<p>    It is a step over from the profitless engagements
of the arithmetical.</p>

<p>    or better : prose has to do with the fact of an
emotion ; poetry has to do with the dynamisation
of emotion into a separate form. This is the force of
imagination.</p>
<p>prose : statement of facts concerning emotions,
intellectua states, data of all sorts — technical expositions,
jargon, of all sorts — fictional and other —</p>
<p>poetry : new form dealt with as a reality in itself.</p>
<p>    the form of prose is the accuracy of its subject
matter-how best to expose the multiform phases of
its material</p>
<p>    the form of poetry is related to the movements of
the imagination revealed in words — or whatever
it may be —</p>
<p>the cleavage is complete</p>
<p>    Why should I go further than I am able ? Is it
not enough for you that I am perfect ?</p>
<p>    The cleavage goes through all the phases of experience.
It is the jump from prose to the process of
imagination that is the next great leap of the intelligence
— from the simulations of present experience
to the facts of the imagination —</p>
<p>the greatest characteristic of the present age is
that it is stale — stale as literature —</p>
<p>    To enter a new world, and have there freedom of
movement and newness.</p>
<p>    I mean that there will always be prose painting,
representative work, clever as may be in revealing
new phases of emotional research presented on the
surface.</p>
<p>    But the jump from that to Cezanne or back to
certain of the primitives is the impossible.</p>
<p>    The primitives are not back in some remote age —
they are not BEHIND experience. Work which
bridges the gap between the rigidities of vulgar experience
and the imagination is rare. It is new, immediate —
It is so because it is actual, always real. It
is experience dynamized into reality.</p>
<p>    Time does not move. Only ignorance and stupidity
move. Intelligence (force, power) stands still with
time and forces change about itself — sifting the
world for permanence, in the drift of nonentity.</p>
<p>    Pio Baroia interested me once —</p>
<p>    Baroja leaving the medical profession, some not
important inspectors work in the north of Spain,
opened a bakery in Madrid.</p>
<p>    The isolation he speaks of, as a member of the so
called intellectual class, influenced him to abandon
his position and engage himself, as far as possible,
in the intricacies of the design patterned by the
social class — He sees no interest in isolation —</p>
<p>    These gestures are the effort for self preservation
or the preservation of some quality held in high
esteem —</p>
<p>    Here it seems to be that a man, starved in imagination,
changes his milieu so that his food may be
richer — The social class, without the power of expression,
lives upon imaginative values.</p>
<p>    I mean only to emphasize the split that goes down
through the abstractions of art to the everyday
exercises of the most primitive types —</p>
<p>    there is a sharp division — the energizing force of
imagination on one side — and the acquisitive —
PROGRESSIVE force of the lump on the other</p>
<p>    The social class with its religion, its faith, sincerity
and all the other imaginative values is positive (yes)</p>
<p>    the merchant, hibernating, unmagnatized —
tends to drop away into the isolate, inactive particles
— Religion is continued then as a form, art as a
convention —</p>
<p>    To the social, energized class — ebullient now in
Russia the particles adhere because of the force
of the imagination energizing them —</p>
<p>    Anyhow the change of Baroja interested me</p>
<p>    Among artists, or as they are sometimes called
" men of imagination " " creators ", etc. this force
is recognized in a pure state — All this can be used
to show the relationships between genius, hand labor,
religion — etc. and the lack of feeling between artists
and the middle class type —</p>
<p>    The jump between fact and the imaginative reality</p>
<p>    The study of all human activity is the deliniation
of the cresence and ebb of this force, shifting from
class to class and location to location — rhythm : the
wave rhythm of Shakespeare watching clowns and
kings sliding into nothing</p>

<p>    The fixed categories into which life is divided must
always hold. These things are normal — essential to
every activity. But they exist — but not as dead
dissections.</p>
<p>    The curriculum of knowledge cannot but be divided
into the sciences, the thousand and one groups of
data, scientific, philosophic or whatnot — as many
as there exist in Shakespeare — things that make
him appear the university of all ages.</p>
<p>    But this is not the thing. In the galvanic category
of — The same things exist, but in a different
condition when energized by the imagination.</p>
<p>    The whole field of education is affected — There
is no end of detail that is without significance.</p>
<p>    Education would begin by placing in the mind of
the student the nature of knowledge — in the dead
state and the nature of the force which may energize
it.</p>
<p>    This would clarify his field at once — He would
then see the use of data</p>
<p>    But at present knowledge is placed before a man
as if it were a stair at the top of which a DEGREE
is obtained which is superlative.</p>
<p>    nothing could be more ridiculous. To data there
is no end. There is proficiency in dissection and a
knowledge of parts but in the use of knowledge —</p>
<p>    It is the imagination that —</p>
<p>    That is : life is absolutely simple. In any civilized
society everyone should know EVERYTHING there
is to know about life at once and always. There should
never be permitted, confusion —</p>
<p>    There are difficulties to life, under conditions there
are impasses, life may prove impossible — But it
must never be lost — as it is today —</p>
<p>    I remember so distinctly the young Pole in Leipzig
going with hushed breath to hear Wundt lecture —
In this mass of intricate philosophic data what one
of the listeners was able to maintain himself for the
winking of an eyelash. Not one. The inundation of
the intelligence by masses of complicated fact is not
knowledge. There is no end —</p>
<p>    And what is the fourth dimension ? It is the endlessness
of knowledge —</p>
<p>    It is the imagination on which reality rides — It is
the imagination — It is a cleavage through everything
by a force that does not exist in the mass and
therefore can never be discovered by its anatomitization.</p>
<p>    It is for this reason that I have always placed art
first and esteemed it over science — in spite of everything.</p>
<p>    Art is the pure effect of the force upon which science
depends for its reality — Poetry</p>
<p>    The effect of this realization upon life will be the
emplacement of knowledge into a living current —
which it has always sought —</p>
<p>    In other times — men counted it a tragedy to be
dislocated from sense — Today boys are sent with
dullest faith to technical schools of all sorts — broken,
bruised</p>
<p>    few escape whole — slaughter. This is not civilization
but stupidity — Before entering knowledge the
integrity of the imagination —</p>
<p>    The effect will be to give importance to the subdivisions
of experience — which today are absolutely
lost — There exists simply nothing.</p>
<p>    Prose — When values are important, such — For
example there is no use denying that prose and poetry
are not by any means the same IN INTENTION.
But then what is prose ? There is no need for it to
approach poetry except to be weakened.</p>
<p>    With decent knowledge to hand we can tell what
things are for</p>
<p>    I except to see values blossom. I expect to see
prose be prose. Prose, relieved of extraneous, unrelated
values must return to its only purpose : to clarity
to enlighten the understanding. There is no form
to prose but that which depends on clarity. If prose
is not acurately adjusted to the exposition of fats
it does not exist — Its form is that alone. To penetrate
everywhere with enlightenment —</p>
<p>    Poetry is something quite different. Poetry has to
do with the crystalization of the imagination — the
perfection of new forms as additions to nature —
Prose may follow to enlighten but poetry —</p>
<p>    Is what I have written prose ? The only answer is
that form in prose ends with the end of that which
is being communicated — If the power to go on falters
in the middle of a sentence — that is the end of the s
entence — Or if a new phase enters at that point it
is only stupidity to go on.</p>
<p>    There is no confusion — only difficulties.</p>

    I do not

    seek a path
    I am still with

    Gipsie lips pressed
    to my own

    It is the kiss
    of leaves

    without being
    poison ivy

    or nettle, the kiss
    of oak leaves —

    a leaf

    through
    a canopy of leaves

    and at the same time
    I descend

    for I do nothing
    unusual —

    I think about

    prehistoric caves

<p>    The nature of the difference between what is
termed prose on the one hand and verse on the other
is not to be discovered by a study of the metrical
characteristics of the words as they occur in juxtaposition.
It is ridiculous to say that verse grades off
into prose as the rythm becomes less and less pronounced,
in fact, that verse differs from prose in that
the meter is more pronounced, that the movement is
more impassioned and that rhythmical prose, so
called, occupies a middle place between prose and
verse.</p>
<p>    It is true that verse is likely to be more strongly
stressed than what is termed prose, but to say that
this is in any way indicative of the difference in
nature of the two is surely to make the mistake of
arguing from the particular to the general, to the
effect that since an object has a certain character
that therefore the force which gave it form will
alwavs reveal itself in that character.</p>
<p>    Of course there is nothing to do but to differentiate
prose from verse by the only effective means at hand,
the external, surface appearance. But a counter proposal
may be made, to wit : that verse is of such a
nature that it may appear without metrical stress
of any sort and that prose may be strongly stressed
— in short that meter has nothing to do with the
question whatever.</p>
<p>    Of course it may be said that if the difference is
felt and is not discoverable to the eve and ear then
what about it anyway ? Or it may be argued, that
since there is according to my proposal no discoverable
difference between prose and verse that in all
probability none exists and that both are phases of
the same thing.</p>
<p>    Yet, quite plainly, there is a very marked difference
between the two which may arise in the
fact of a separate origin for each, each using similar
modes for dis-similar purposes ; verse falling most
commonly into meter but not always, and prose
going forward most often without meter but not
alwavs.</p>
<p>    This at least serves to explain some of the best
work I see today and explains some of the most
noteworthy failures which I discover. I search for
" something " in the writing which moves me in a
certain way — It offers a suggestion as to why some
work of Whitman's is bad poetry and some, in the
same meter is prose.</p>
<p>    The practical point would be to discover when a
work is to be taken as coming from this source
and when from that. When discovering a work it
would be — If it is poetry it means this and only
this — and if it is prose it means that and only
that. Anything else is a confusion, silly and bad
practice.</p>
<p>    I believe this is possible as I believe in the main
that Marianne Moore is of all American writers most
constantly a poet — not because her lines are invarjably
full of imagery they are not, they are often
diagramatically informative, and not because she
clips her work into certain shapes — her pieces
are without meter most often — but I believe she
is most constantly a poet in her work because
the purpose of her work is invariably from the
source from which poetry starts — that it is constantly
from the purpose of poetry. And that it
actually possesses this characteristic, as of that
origin, to a more distinguishable degree when it
eschews verse rhythms than when it does not. It has
the purpose of poetry written into and therefore it
is poetry.</p>
<p>    I believe it possible, even essential, that when
poetry fails it does not become prose but bad poetry.
The test of Mariane Moore would be that she writes
sometimes good and sometimes bad poetry but
always — with a single purpose out of a single fountain
which is of the sort —</p>
<p>    The practical point would be to discover —</p>
<p>    I can go no further than to say that poetry feeds
the imagination and prose the emotions, poetry
liberates the words from their emotional implications,
prose confirms them in it. Both move centrifugally
or centripetally toward the intelligence.</p>
<p>    Of course it must be understood that writing
deals with words and words only and that all discussions
of it deal with single words and their association
in groups.</p>
<p>    As far as I can discover there is no way but the
one I have marked out which will satisfactorily deal
with certain lines such as occur in some play of
Shakespeare or in a poem of Marianne Moore's, let us
say : Tomorrow will be the first of April —</p>
<p>    Certainly there is an emotional content in this for
anyone living in the northern temperate zone, but
whether it is prose or poetry — taken by itself —
who is going to say unless some mark is put on
it by the intent conveved by the words which
surround it —</p>
<p>    Either to write or to comprehend poetry the
words must be recognized to be moving in a direction
separate from the jostling or lack of it which occurs
within the piece.</p>
<p>    Marianne's words remain separate, each unwilling
to group with the others except as they move in the
one direction. This is even an important — or amusing
— character of Miss Moore's work.</p>
<p>    Her work puzzles me. It is not easy to quote
convincingly.</p>

<p>    The imagination uses the phraseology of science.
It attacks, stirs, animates, is radio-active in all that
can be touched by action. Words occur in liberation
by virtue of its processes.</p>
<p>    In description words adhere to certain objects.
and have the effect on the sense of oysters, or
barnacles.</p>
<p>    But the imagination is wrongly understood when
it is supposed to be a removal from reality in the
sense of John of Gaunt's speech in Richard the
Second : to imagine possession of that which is lost.
It is rightly understood when John of Gaunt's
words are related not to their sense as objects
adherent to his son's welfare or otherwise but
as a dance over the body of his condition accurately
accompanying it. By this means of the understanding,
the play written to be understood as a play,
the author and reader are liberated to pirouette
with the words which have sprung from the old facts
of history, reunited in present passion.</p>
<p>    To understand the words as so liberated is to
understand poetry. That they move independantly
when set free is the mark of their value</p>
<p>    Imagination is not to avoid reality, nor is it description
nor an evocation of objects or situations, it is to
say that poetry does not tamper with the world but
moves it — It affirms reality most powerfully and
therefore, since reality needs no personal support but
exists free from human action, as proven by science
in the indestructibility of matter and of force, it
creates a new object, a play, a dance which is not a
mirror up to nature but —</p>
<p>    As birds' wings beat the solid air without which
none could fly so words freed by the imagination
affirm reality by their flight
    Writing is likened to music. The object would be
it seems to make poetry a pure art, like music.
Painting too. Writing, as with certain of the modern
Russians whose work I have seen, would use unoriented
sounds in place of conventional words. The
poem then would be completely liberated when
there is identity of sound with something — perhaps
the emotion.</p>
<p>    I do not believe that writing is music. I do not
believe writing would gain in quality or force by
seeking to attain to the conditions of music.</p>
<p>    I think the conditions of music are objects for the
action of the writer's imagination just as a table
or —</p>
<p>    According to my present theme the writer of
imagination would attain closest to the conditions
of music not when his words are disassociated from
natural objects and specified meanings but when
they are liberated from the usual quality of that
meaning by transposition into another medium,
the imagination.</p>
<p>    Sometimes I speak of imagination as a force,
an electricity or a medium, a place. It is immaterial
which : for whether it is the condition of a place or
a dynamization its effect is the same : to free the
world of fact from the impositions of " art " (see
Hartley's last chapter) and to liberate the man to
act in whatever direction his disposition leads.</p>
<p>    The word is not liberated, therefore able to
communicate release from the fixities which destroy
it until it is accurately tuned to the fact which giving
it reality, by its own reality establishes its own
freedom from the necessity of a word, thus freeing
it and dynamizing it at the same time.</p>
