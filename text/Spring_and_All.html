            IF anything of moment resulls —— so much the
            better. And so much the more likely will it be
            that no one will want to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a constant barrier between the reader
            and his consciousness of immediate contact with
            the world. If there is an ocean it is here. Or rather,
            the whole world is between : Yesterday, tomorrow,
            Europe, Asia, Africa, —— all things removed and
            impossible, the tower of the church at Seville, the
            Parthenon.

            What do they mean when they say: „ I do not
            like your poems ; you have no faith whatever. You
            seem neither to have suffered nor, in fact, to have
            felt anything very deeply. There is nothing appealing
            in what you say but on the contrary the poems are
            positively repellant. They are heartless, cruel, they
            make fun of humanity. What in God's name do you
            mean? Are you a pagan ? Have you no tolerance
            for human frailty ? Rhyme you may perhaps take
            away but rythm ! why there is none in your work
            whatever. Is this what you call poetry ? It is the
            very antithesis of poetry. It is antipoetry. It is the
            annihilation of life upon which you are bent. Poetry
            that used to go hand in hand with life, poetry that
            interpreted our deepest promptings, poetry that
            inspired, that led us forward to new discoveries,
            new depths of tolerance, new heights of exaltation.
            You moderns ! it is the death of poetry that you are
            accomplishing. No. I cannot understand this work.
            You have not yet suffered a cruel blow from life.
            When vou have suffered you will write differently ? »
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps this noble apostrophy means something
            terrible for me, I am not certain, but for the moment
            I interpret it to say : « You have robbed me. God,
            I am naked. What shall I do ? » —— By it they mean
            that when I have suffered (provided I have not done
            so as yet) I too shall run for cover ; that I too shall
            seek refuge in fantasy. And mind you, I do not say
            that I will not. To decorate my age.
        </p>
        <p>
            But today it is different.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reader knows himself as he was twenty years
            ago and he has also in mind a vision of what he would
            be, some day. Oh, some day! But the thing he never
            knows and never dares to know is what he is at the
            exact moment that he is. And this moment is the
            only thing in which I am at all interested. Ergo,
            who cares for anything I do? And what do I care ?
        </p>
        <p>
            I love my fellow creature. Jesus, how I love him :
            endways, sideways, frontways and all the other ways
            —— but he doesn't exist ! Neither does she. I do, in
            a bastardly sort of way.
        </p>
        <p>
            To whom then am I addressed ? To the imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact to return upon my theme for the time
            nearly all writing, up to the present, if not all art,
            has been especially designed to keep up the barrier
            between sense and the vaporous fringe which distracts
            the attention from its agonized approaches
            to the moment. It has been always a search for „ the
            beautiful illusion ". Very well. I am not in search of
            „ the beautiful illusion ".
        </p>
        <p>
            And if when I pompously announce that I am
            addressed —— To the imagination —— you believe that
            I thus divorce myself from life and so defeat my own
            end, I reply : To refine, to clarify, to intensify that
            eternal moment in which we alone live there is but
            a single force —— the imagination. This is its book.
            I myself invite you to read and to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the imagination, we are from henceforth (so
            long as you read) locked in a fraternal embrace, the
            classic caress of author and reader. We are one.
            Whenever I say „ I " I mean also „ you ". And so,
            together, as one, we shall begin.
        </p>
        <p>
            CHAPTER 19
        </p>
        <p>
            o meager times, so fat in everything imaginable!
            imagine the New World that rises to our windows
            from the sea on Mondays and on Saturdays —— and
            on every other day of the week also. Imagine it in
            all its prismatic colorings, its counterpart in our
            souls —— our souls that are great pianos whose strings,
            of honey and of steel, the divisions of the rainbow
            set twanging, loosing on the air great novels of
            adventure ! Imagine the monster project of the
            moment : Tomorrow we the people of the United
            States are going to Europe armed to kill every man,
            woman and child in the area west of the Carpathian
            Mountains (also east) sparing none. Imagine the
            sensation it will cause. First we shall kill them
            and then they, us. But we are careful to spare the Spanish
            bulls, the birds, rabbits, small deer and of course ——
            the Russians. For the Russians we shall build a
            bridge from edge to edge of the Atlantic —— having
            first been at pains to slaughter all Canadians and
            Mexicans on this side. Then, oh then, the great feature
            will take place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Never mind ; the great event may not exist, so
            there is no need to speak further of it. Kill ! kill !
            the English, the Irish, the French, the Germans,
            the Italians and the rest : friends or enemies, it makes
            no difference, kill them all. The bridge is to be blown
            up when all Russia is upon it. And why ?
        </p>
        <p>
            Because we love them —— all. That is the secret :
            a new sort of murder. We make leberwurst of them.
            Bratwurst. But why, since we are ourselves doomed
            to suffer the same annihilation ?
        </p>
        <p>
            If I could say what is in my mind in Sanscrit or
            even Latin I would do so. But I cannot. I speak for
            the integrity of the soul and the greatness of life's
            inanity ; the formality of its boredom ; the orthodoxy
            of its stupidity. Kill ! kill ! let there be fresh
            meat...
        </p>
        <p>
            The imagination, intoxicated by prohibitions,
            rises to drunken heights to destroy the world. Let
            it rage, let it kill. The imagination is supreme. To it
            all our works forever, from the remotest past to the
            farthest future, have been, are and will be dedicated.
            To it alone we show our wit by having raised in its
            honor as monument not the least pebble. To it now
            we come to dedicate our secret project: the annihilation
            of every human creature on the face of the
            earth. This is something never before attempted.
            None to remain ; nothing but the lower vertebrates,
            the mollusks, insects and plants. Then at last will
            the world be made anew. Houses crumble to ruin,
            cities disappear giving place to mounds of soil blown
            thither by the winds, small bushes and grass give way
            to trees which grow old and are succeeded by other
            trees for countless generations. A marvellous serenity
            broken only by bird and wild beast calls reigns over
            the entire sphere. Order and peace abound.
        </p>
        <p>
            This final and self inflicted holocaust has been
            all for love, for sweetest love, that together the human
            race, yellow, black, brown, red and white, agglutinated
            into one enormous soul may be gratified with the
            sight and retire to the heaven of heavens content to
            rest on its laurels. There, soul of souls, watching its
            own horrid unity, it boils and digests itself within
            the tissues of the great Being of Eternity that we
            shall then have become. With what magnificent
            explosions and odors will not the day be accomplished
            as we, the Great One among all creatures, shall
            go about contemplating our self-prohibited desires
            as we promenade them before the inward review
            of our own bowels —— et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...
            and it is spring —— both in Latin and Turkish, in
            English and Dutch, in Japanese and Italian ; it is
            spring by Stinking River where a magnolia tree,
            without leaves, before what was once a farmhouse,
            now a ramshackle home for millworkers, raises its
            straggling branches of ivorywhite flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
            CHAPTER XIII
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, weary of life, in view of the great consummation
            which awaits us —— tomorrow, we rush among
            our friends congratulating ourselves upon the joy
            soon to be. Thoughtless of evil we crush out the
            marrow of those about us with our heavy cars as
            we go happily from place to place. It seems that
            there is not time enough in which to speak the full
            of our exaltation. Only a day is left, one miserable
            day, before the world comes into its own. Let us
            hurry ! Why bother for this man or that ? In the
            offices of the great newspapers a mad joy reigns as
            they prepare the final extras. Rushing about, men
            bump each other into the whirring presses. How
            funny it seems. All thought of misery has left us.
            Why should we care? Children laughingly fling
            themselves under the wheels of the street cars,
            airplanes crash gaily to the earth. Someone has
            written a poem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh life, bizarre fowl, what color are your wings?
            Green, blue, red, yellow, purple, white, brown,
            orange, black, grey? In the imagination, flying
            above the wreck of ten thousand million souls, I see
            you departing sadly for the land of plants and insects,
            already far out to sea. (Thank you, I know well what
            I am plagiarising) Your great wings flap as you
            disappear in the distance over the pre-Columbian
            acres of floating weed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new cathedral overlooking the park, looked
            down from its towers today, with great eyes, and
            saw by the decorative lake a group of people staring
            curiously at the corpse of a suicide : Peaceful, dead
            young man, the money they have put into the stones
            has been spent to teach men of life's austerity. You
            died and teach us the same lesson. You seem a
            cathedral, celebrant of the spring which shivers for
            me among the long black trees.
        </p>
        <p>
            CHAPTER VI
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, in the imagination, all flesh, all human
            flesh has been dead upon the earth for ten million,
            billion years. The bird has turned into a stone within
            whose heart an egg, unlayed, remained hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is spring ! but miracle of miracles a miraculous
            miracle has gradually taken place during these
            seemingly wasted eons. Through the orderly sequences
            of unmentionable time EVOLUTION HAS
            REPEATED ITSELF FROM THE BEGINNING.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good God!
        </p>
        <p>
            Every step once taken in the first advance of the
            human race, from the amoeba to the highest type
            of intelligence, has been duplicated, every step
            exactly paralleling the one that preceded in the
            dead ages gone by. A perfect plagiarism results.
            Everything is and is new. Only the imagination is
            undeceived.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point the entire complicated and laborious
            process begins to near a new day. (More of this in
            Chapter XIX) But for the moment everything is
            fresh, perfect, recreated.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact now, for the first time, everything IS new.
            Now at last the perfect effect is being witlessly discovered.
            The terms „ veracity " „ actuality " „ real "
            „ natural " „ sincere " are being discussed at length,
            every word in the discussion being evolved from an
            identical discussion which took place the day before
            yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, the imagination, drunk with prohibitions,
            has destroyed and recreated everything afresh in
            the likeness of that which it was. Now indeed men
            look about in amazement at each other with a full
            realization of the meaning of „ art ".
        </p>
        <p>
            CHAPTER 2
        </p>
        <p>
            It is spring: life again begins to assume its normal
            appearence as of „ today ". Only the imagination
            is undeceived. The volcanos are extinct. Coal is
            beginning to be dug again where the fern forests
            stood last night. (If an error is noted here, pay no
            attention to it).
        </p>
        <p>
            CHAPTER XIX
        </p>
        <p>
            I realize that the chapters are rather quick in their
            sequence and that nothing much is contained in any
            one of them but no one should be surprised at this
            today.
        </p>
        <p>
            THE TRADITIONALISTS OF PLAGIARISM
        </p>
        <p>
            It is spring. That is to say, it is approaching THE
            BEGINNING.
        </p>
        <p>
            In that huge and microscopic career of time, as it
            were a wild horse racing in an illimitable pampa
            under the stars, describing immense and microscopic
            circles with his hoofs on the solid turf, running
            without a stop for the millionth part of a second
            until he is aged and worn to a heap of skin, bones
            and ragged hoofs —— In that majestic progress of life,
            that gives the exact impression of Phidias' frizze,
            the men and beasts of which, though they seem of
            the rigidity of marble are not so but move, with
            blinding rapidity, though we do not have the time
            to notice it, their legs advancing a millionth part
            of an inch every fifty thousand years —— In that
            progress of life which seems stillness itself in the mass
            of its movements —— at last SPRING is approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            In that colossal surge toward the finite and the
            capable life has now arrived for the second time at
            that exact moment when in the ages past the destruction
            of the species Homo sapiens occured.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now at last that process of miraculous verisimilitude,
            that grate copying which evolution has
            followed, repeating move for move every move that
            it made in the past —— is approaching the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly it is at an end. THE WORLD IS NEW.
        </p>
        <p>
            I
        </p>
        <p>
            By the road to the contagious hospital
            under the surge of the blue
            mottled clouds driven from the
            northeast —— a cold wind. Beyond, the
            waste of broad, muddy fields
            brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen
        </p>
        <p>
            patches of standing water
            the scattering of tall trees
        </p>
        <p>
            All along the road the reddish
            purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy
            stuff of bushes and small trees
            with dead, brown leaves under them
            leafless vines ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Lifeless in appearance, sluggish
            dazed spring approaches ——
        </p>
        <p>
            They enter the new world naked,
            cold, uncertain of all
            save that they enter. All about them
            the cold, familiar wind ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the grass, tomorrow
            the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf
        </p>
        <p>
            One by one objects are defined — 
            It quickens : clarity, outline of leaf
        </p>
        <p>
            But now the stark dignity of
            entrance —— Still, the profound change
            has come upon then : rooted they
            grip down and begin to awaken
        </p>
        <p>
            II
        </p>
        <p>

            flowers and flowers reversed

            darting it back
            into the lamp's horn

        <p>
            petals aslant darkened with mauve

            petal lays its glow upon petal

            petals radiant with transpiercing light

            and there, wholly dark, the pot
            gay with rough moss.
        </p>
        <p>
            A terrific confusion has taken place. No man knows
            whither to turn. There is nothing ! Emptiness stares
            us once more in the face. Whither ? To what end ?
            Each asks the other. Has life its tail in its mouth or
            its mouth in its tail ? Why are we here ? Dora
            Marsden's philosophic algebra. Everywhere men look
            into each other's faces and ask the old unanswerable
            question : Whither ? How ? What ? Why ?
        </p>
        <p>
            At any rate, now at last spring is here !
        </p>
        <p>
            The rock has split, the egg has hatched, the prismatically
            plumed bird of life has escaped from its
            cage. It spreads its wings and is perched now on
            the peak of the huge African mountain Kilimanjaro.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strange recompense, in the depths of our despair
            at the unfathomable mist into which all mankind is
            plunging, a curious force awakens. It is HOPE long
            asleep, aroused once more. Wilson has taken an army
            of advisers and sailed for England. The ship has
            sunk. But the men are all good swimmers. They take
            the women on their shoulders and buoyed on by the
            inspiration of the moment they churn the free seas
            with their sinewey arms, like Ulysses, landing all
            along the European seaboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, hope has awakened once more in men's
            hearts. It is the NEW ! Let us go forward !
        </p>
        <p>
            The imagination, freed from the handeuffs of
            „ art ", takes the lead ! Her feet are bare and not
            too delicate. In fact those who come behind her have
            much to think of. Hm. Let it pass.

            CHAPTER I
        </p>
        <p>
            SAMUEL BUTLER
        </p>
        <p>
            The great English divine, Sam Butler, is shouting
            from a platform, warning us as we pass: There are
            two who can invent some extraordinary thing to
            one who can properly employ that which has been
            made use of before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enheartened by this thought THE
            TRADITIONALISTS OF PLAGIARISM try to get hold
            of the mob. They seize those nearest them and shout
            into their ears : Tradition ! The solidarity of life!
        </p>
        <p>
            The fight is on : These men who have had the
            governing of the mob through all the repetitious
            years resent the new order. Who can answer them ?
            One perhaps here and there but it is an impossible
            situation. If life were anything but a bird, if it were
            a man, a Greek or an Egyptian, but it is only a bird
            that has eyes and wings, a beak, talons and a cry
            that reaches to every rock's center, but without
            intelligence ? ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The voice of the Delphic Oracle itself, what was
            it ? A poisonous gas from a rock's cleft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who led yesterday wish to hold their sway
            a while longer. It is not difficult to understand their
            mood. They have their great weapons to hand :
            „ science ", „ philosophy " and most dangerous of
            all „ art".
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, SPRING, which has been approaching
            for several pages, is at last here.
        </p>
        <p>
            —— they ask us to return to the proven truths of
            tradition, even to the twice proven, the substantiality
            of which is known. Demuth and a few others
            do their best to point out the error, telling us that
            design is a function of the IMAGINATION, describing
            its movements, its colors —— but it is a hard battle.
            I myself seek to enter the lists with these few notes
            jolted down in the midst of the action, under distracting
            circumstances —— to remind myself (see p. 2,
            paragraph 4) of the truth
        </p>
        <p>
            III
        </p>
        <p>
            The farmer in deep thought
            is pacing through the rain
            among his blank fields, with
            hands in pockets,
            in his head
            the harvest already planted.
            A cold wind ruffles the water
            among the browned weeds.
            On all sides
            the world rolls coldly away :
            black orchards
            darkened by the March clouds ——
            leaving room for thought.
            Down past the brushwood
            bristling by
            the rainsluiced wagonroad
            looms the artist figure of
            the farmer —— composing
            —— antagonist
        </p>
        <p>
            IV
        </p>
        <p>
            The Easter stars are shining
            above lights that are flashing ——
            coronal of the black ——
            Nobody
            to say it ——
            Nobody to say : pinholes
        </p>
        <p>
            Thither I would carry her
            among the lights ——
            Burst it asunder
            break through to the fifty words
            necessary ——
        </p>
        <p>

            a crown for her head with
            castles upon it, skyscrapers
            filled with nut-chocolates ——
        </p>
        <p>
            dovetame winds ——
            stars of tinsel
            from the great end of a cornucopia
            of glass
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

            SO long as the sky is recognised as an assoiciation
        </p>
        <p>
            is recognised in its function of accessory to vague
            words whose meaning it is impossible to rediscover
            its value can be nothing but mathematical certain
            limits of gravity and density of air
        </p>
        <p>
            The farmer and the fisherman who read their own
            lives there have a practical corrective for ——
        </p>
        <p>
            they rediscover or replace demoded meanings
            to the religious terms
        </p>
        <p>
            Among them, without expansion of imagination,
            there is the residual contact between life and the
            imagination which is essential to freedom
        </p>
        <p>
            The man of imagination who turns to art for
            release and fulfilment of his baby promises contends
            with the sky through layers of demoded words and
            shapes. Demoded, not because the essential vitality
            which begot them is laid waste —— this cannot
            be so, a young man feels, since he feels it in himself
            —— but because meanings have been lost through
            laziness or changes in the form of existance which
            have let words empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bare handed the man contends with the sky,
            without experience of existence seeking to invent
            and design
        </p>
        <p>
            Crude svmbolism is to associate emotions
            with natural phenomena such as anger with lightning,
            flowers with love it goes further and associates
            certain textures with
        </p>
        <p>
            Such work is empty. It is very typical of almost
            all that is done by the writers who fill the pages
            every month of such a paper as. Everything that I
            have done in the past —— except those parts which
            may be called excellent —— by chance, have that quality
            about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is typified by use of the word « like » or that
            « evocation » of the « image » which served us for a
            time. Its abuse is apparent. The insignificant « image »
            may be « evoked » never so ably and still mean
            nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all his faults Alfred Kreymborg never did
            this. That is why his work —— escaping a common
            fault —— still has value and will tomorrow have more.

        <p>
            Sandburg, when uninspired by intimacies of the
            eye and ear, runs into this empty symbolism. Such
            poets of promise as ruin themselves with it, though
            many have major sentimental faults besides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marianne Moore escapes. The incomprehensibility
            of her poems is witness to at what cost (she cleaves
            herself away) as it is also to the distance which the
            most are from a comprehension of the purpose of
            composition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The better work men do is always done under
            stress and at great personal cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is no different from the aristocratic compositions
            of the earlier times, The Homeric inventions
            but
            these occured in different times, to this extent, that
            life had not yed sieved through its own multiformity.
            That aside, the work the two-thousand-year-old poet
            did and that we do are one piece. That is the vitality
            of the classics.
        </p>
        <p>
            So then —— Nothing is put down in the present book
            —except through weakness of the imagination ——
            which is not intended as of a piece with the « nature »
            which Shakespeare mentions and which Hartley
            speaks of so completely in his « Adventures » : it is
            the common thing which is anonymously about us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Composition is in no essential an escape from life.
            In fact if it is so it is negligeable to the point of
            insignificance. Whatever « life » the artist may be forced
            to lead has no relation to the vitality of his compositions.
            Such names as Homer, the blind ; Scheherazade,
            who lived under threat —— Their compositions
            have as their excellence an identity with life since
            they are as actual, as sappy as the leaf of the tree
            which never moves from one spot.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I put down of value will have this value :
            an escape from crude symbolism, the annihilation
            of strained associations, complicated ritualistic forms
            designed to separate the work from « reality » —— such
            as rhyme, meter as meter and not as the essential of
            the work, one of its words.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this smacks too much of the nature of —— This
            is all negative and appears to be boastful. It is not
            intended to be so. Rather the opposite
        </p>
        <p>
            The work will be in the realm of the imagination
            as plain as the sky is to a fisherman —— A very clouded
            sentence. The word must be put down for itself, not
            as a symbol of nature but a part, cognisant of the
            whole —— aware —— civilized.

            in himself crushing humiliation unless the individual
            raise to some approximate co-extension with the
            universe. This is possible by aid of the imagination.
            Only through the ageney of this force can a man feel
            himself moved largely with sympathetic pulses at

            A work of the imagination which fails to release
            the senses in accordance with this major requisite ——
            the sympathies, the intelligence in its selective world,
            fails at the elucidation, the alleviation which is ——
            In the composition, the artist does exactly what
            every eye must do with life, fix the particular with
            the universality of his own personality —— Taught by
            the largeness of his imagination to feel every form
            which he sees moving within himself, he must prove
            the truth of this by expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contraction which is felt.
        </p>
        <p>
            All this being anterior to technique, that can have
            only a sequent value ; but since all that appears to
            the senses on a work of art does so through
            fixation by
            the imagination of the external as well internal means
            of expression the essential nature of technique or
            transcription.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only when this position is reached can life proper
            be said to begin since only then ean a value be affixed
            to the forms and activities of which it consists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only then can the sense of frustration which ends.
            All composition defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only through the imagination is the advance of
            intelligence possible, to keep beside growing understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complete lack of imagination would be the same
            at the cost of intelligence, complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even the most robust constitution has its limits,
            though the Roman feast with its reliance upon regurgitation
            to prolong it shows an active ingenuity, yet
            the powers of a man are so pitifully small, with the
            ocean to swallow —— that at the end of the feast
            nothing would be left but suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
            That or the imagination which in this ease takes
            the form of humor, is known in that form —— the
            release from physical necessity. Having eaten to the
            full we must acknowledge our insufficiency since we
            have not annihilated all food nor even the quantity
            of a good sized steer. However we have annihilated
            all eating : quite plainly we have no more appetite.
            This is to say that the imagination has removed us
            from the banal necessity of bursting ourselves —— by
            acknowledging a new siluation. We must acknowledge
            that the ocean we would drink is too vast —— but at
            the same time we realize that extension in our case
            is not confined to the intestine only. The stomach
            is full, the ocean no fuller, both have the same qua=
            lity of fullness. In that, then, one is equal to the
            other. Having eaten, the man has released his mind.

            THIS catalogue might be increased to larger proportions
            without stimulating the sense.

        <p>
            In works of the imagination that which is taken
            for great good sense, so that it seems as if an accurate
            precept were discovered, is in reality not so, but
            vigor and accuracy of the imagination alone. In work
            such as Shakespeares ——
        </p>
        <p>
            This leads to the discovery that has been made
            today —— old catalogues aside —— full of meat ——
        </p>
        <p>
            " the divine illusion has about it that inaccuracy
            which reveals that which I mean ".
        </p>
        <p>
            There is only „ illusion " in art where ignorance
            of the bystander confuses imagination and its works
            with cruder processes. Truly men feel an enlargement
            before great or good work, an expansion but
            this is not, as so many believe today a „ lie ", a
            stupefaction, a kind of mesmerism, a thing to block
            out " life ", bitter to the individual, by a " vision
            of beauty ". It is a work of the imagination. It
            gives the feeling of completion by revealing the
            oneness of experience ; it rouses rather than stupefies
            the intelligence by demonstrating the importance
            of personality, by showing the individual, depressed
            before it, that his life is valuable —— when completed
            by the imagination. And then only. Such work
            elucidates ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a realization shows us the falseness of
            allempling to " copy " nature. The thing is equally
            silly when we try to " make " pictures ——
        </p>
        <p>
            But such a picture as that of Juan Gris, though
            I have not seen it in color, is important as marking
            more clearly than any I have seen what the modern
            trend is : the attempt is being made to separate
            things of the imagination from life, and obviously,
            by using the forms common to experience so as
            not to frighten the onlooker away but to invite
            him,

            The rose is obsolete

            an edge, the double facet

            columns of air —— The edge
            cuts without cutting

            things with which he is familiar, simple things
            —— at the same time to detach them from ordinary
            experience to the imagination. Thus they are still
            " real " they are the same things they would be
            it photographed or painted by Monet, they
            are recognizable as the things touched by the hands
            during the day, but in this painting they are seen
            to be in some peculiar way —— detached

            Here is a shutter, a bunch of grapes, a sheet of
            music, a picture of sea and mountains (particularly
            fine) which the onlooker is not for a moment permitted
            to witness as an " illusion ". One thing laps over
            on the other, the cloud laps over on the shutter,
            the bunch of grapes is part of the handle
            of the guitar, the mountain and sea are obviously not
            " the mountain and sea ", but a picture of the
            mountain and the sea. All drawn with admirable
            simplicity and excellent design —— all a unity ——
        </p>
        <p>
            This was not necessary where the subject of art
            was not " reality " but related to the " gods " ——
            by force or otherwise. There was no need of the
            " illusion " in such a case since there was none
            possible where a picture or a work represented
            simply the imaginative reality which existed in the
            mind of the onlooker. No special effort was necessary
            to cleave where the cleavage already existed.

            I don't know what the Spanish see in their Velasquez

        <p>
            Today where everything is being brought into
            sight the realism of art has bewildered us, confused
            us and forced us to re-invent in order to retain
            that which the older generations had without that
            effort.

            Cezanne ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The only realism in art is of the imagination.
            It is only thus that the work escapes plagiarism
            after nature and becomes a creation
        </p>
        <p>
            Invention of new forms to embody this reality
            of art, the one thing which art is, must occupy all
            serious minds concerned.

        <p>
            From the time of Poe in the U. S. —— the first
            American poet had to be a man of great separation ——
            with close identity with life. Poe could not have
            written a word without the violence of expulsive
            emotion combined with the in-driving force of a
            crudely repressive environment. Between the two
            his imagination was forced into being to keep him
            to that reality, completeness, sense of escape which
            is felt in his work —— his topics. Typically American
            —— accurately, even inevitably set in his time.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, after this tedious diversion —— whatever of
            dull you find among my work, put it down to criticism,
            not to poetry. You will not be mistaken ——
            Who am I but my own critic? Surely in isolation
            one becomes a god —— At least one becomes something
            of everything, which is not wholly godlike, yet a
            little so —— in many things.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not necessary to count every flake of the
            truth that falls ; it is necessary to dwell in the
            imagination if the truth is to be numbered. It is
            necessary to speak from the imagination ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The great furor about perspective in Holbein's
            day had as a consequence much fine drawing, it
            made coins defy gravity, standing on the table as
            if in the act of falling. To say this was lifelike must
            have been satisfying to the master, it gave depth,
            pungency.
        </p>
        <p>
            But all the while the picture escaped notice ——
            partly because of the perspective. Or if noticed it
            was for the most part because one could see " the
            birds pecking at the grapes " in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile the birds were pecking at the grapes
            outside the window and in the next street Bauermeister
            Kummel was letting a gold coin slip from
            his fingers to the counting table.
        </p>
        <p>
            The representation was perfect, it " said something
            one was used to hearing " but with verve,
            cleverly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus perspective and clever drawing kept the
            picture continually under cover of the " beautiful
            illusion " until today, when even Anatole France
            trips, saying: " Art —— all lies! " —— today when we
            are beginning to discover the truth that in great
            works of the imagination A CREATIVE FORCE IS
            SHOWN AT WORK MAKING OBJECTS WHICH
            ALONE COMPLETE SCIENCE AND ALLOW
            INTELLIGENCE TO SURVIVE —— his picture
            lives anew. It lives as pictures only can : by their
            power TO ESCAPE ILLUSION and stand between
            man and nature as saints once stood between man
            and the sky —— their reality in such work, say, as
            that of Juan Gris
        </p>
        <p>
            No man could suffer the fragmentary nature of
            his understanding of his own life ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Whitman's proposals are of the same piece with the
            modern trend toward imaginative understanding of l
            ife. The largeness which he interprets as his identity
            with the least and the greatest about him, his " democracy "
            represents the vigor of his imaginative
            life.

            end over end in the air !
        </p>
        <p>
            But what would you have?
        </p>
        <p>
            All I said was :
            there, you see, it is broken
        </p>
        <p>
            stockings, shoes, hairpins
            your bed, I wrapped myself round you ——
        </p>
        <p>
            I watched.
        </p>
        <p>
            You sobbed, you beat your pillow
            you tore your hair
            you dug your nails into your sides
        </p>
        <p>
            I was your nightgown
            I watched !
        </p>
        <p>
            Clean is he alone
            after whom stream
            the broken pieces of the city ——
            flying apart at his approaches
        </p>
        <p>
            but I merely
            caress you curiously
        </p>
        <p>
            fifteen years ago and you still
            go about the city, they say
            patching up sick school children
        </p>
        <p>
            Understood in a practical way, without calling
            upon mystic agencies, of this or that order, it is that
            life becomes actual only when it is identified with
            ourselves. When we name it, life exists. To repeat
            physical experiences has no ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The only means he has to give value to life is to
            recognise it with the imagination and name it ; this is
            so. To repeat and repeat the thing without naming
            it is only to dull the sense and results in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
            this make the artist the prey of life. He is easy of
            attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think often of my earlier work and what it has cost
            me not to have been clear. I acknowledge I have
            moved chaotically about refusing or rejecting most
            things, seldom accepting values or acknowledging
            anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            because I early recognised the
            futility of acquisitive understanding and at the same
            time rejected religious dogmatism. My whole life has
            been spent (so far) in seeking to place a value upon
            experience and the objects of experience that would
            satisfy my sense of inclusiveness without redundancy
            —— completeness, lack of frustration with the liberty
            of choice; the things which the pursuit of « art »
            offers ——
        </p>
        <p>
            But though I have felt « free » only in the presence
            of works of the imagination, knowing the quickening
            of the sense which came of it, and though this experience
            has held me firm at such times, yet being of a
            slow but accurate understanding, I have not always
            been able to complete the intellectual steps which
            would make me firm in the position.
        </p>
        <p>
            So most of my life has been lived in hell —— a hell
            of repression lit by flashes of inspiration, when a
            poem such as this or that would appear
        </p>
        <p>
            What would have happened in a world similarly
            lit by the imagination
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh yes, you are a writter ! a phrase that has often
            damned me, to myself. I rejected it with heat but
            the stigma remained. Not a man, not an understanding
            but a WRITER. I was unable to recognize.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not forget with what heat too I condemned
            some poems of some contemporary praised because
            of their loveliness ——
        </p>
        <p>
            I find that I was somewhat mistaken —— ungenerous
        </p>
        <p>
            Life's processes are very simple. One or two moves
            are made and that is the end. The rest is repetitious.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Improvisations —— coming at a time when I
            was trying to remain firm at great cost —— I had
            recourse to the expedient of letting life go completely
            in order to live in the world of my choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I let the imagination have its
            own way to see if it could save itself. Something
            very definite came of it. I found myself alleviated but
            most important I began there and then to revalue
            experience, to understand what I was at ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The virtue of the improvisations is their placement
            in a world of new values ——
        </p>
        <p>
            their fault is their dislocation of
            sense, often complete. But it is the best I could do
            under the circumstances. It was the best I could
            do and retain any value to experience at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I have come to a different condition. I find
            that the values there discovered can be extended. I
            find myself extending the understanding to the work
            of others and to other things ——
        </p>
        <p>
            I find that there is work to be done in the
            creation of new forms, new names for experience
        </p>
        <p>
            and that « beauty » is related not to « loveliness »
            but to a state in which reality playes a part
        </p>
        <p>
            Such painting as that of Juan Gris, coming after
            the impressionists, the expressionists, Cezanne ——
            and dealing severe strokes as well to the expressionits
            as to the impressionists group —— points forward
            to what will prove the greatest painting yet produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            —— the illusion once dispensed with, painting has
            this problem before it : to replace not the forms but
            the reality of experience with its own ——
        </p>
        <p>
            up to now shapes and meanings but always the
            illusion relving on composition to give likeness to
            « nature »
        </p>
        <p>
            now works of art cannot be left in this category of
            France's « lie », they must be real, not « realism » but
            reality itself ——
        </p>
        <p>
            they must give not the sense of frustration but a
            sense of completion, of actuality —— It is not a matter
            of « representation » —— much may be represented
            actually, but of separate existence.

        <p>
            virtue of the law ——
            I saw
        </p>
        <p>
            an elderly man who
            smiled and looked away
        </p>
        <p>
            to the north past a house ——
            a woman in blue
        </p>
        <p>
            who was laughing
            and leaning forward to look up
        </p>
        <p>
            into the man's half
            averted face
        </p>
        <p>
            and a boy of eight who was
            looking at the middle of
        </p>
        <p>
            the man's belly
            at a watchchain ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The supreme importance
            of this nameless spectacle
        </p>
        <p>
            sped me by them
            without a word ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Why bother where I went ?
            for I went spinning on the
        </p>
        <p>
            four wheels of my car
            along the wet road until
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw a girl with one leg
            over the rail of a balcony
        </p>
        <p>
            When in the condition of imaginative suspense
            only will the writting have reality, as explained
            partially in what preceeds —— Not to attempt, at that
            time, to set values on the word being used, according
            to presupposed measures, but to write down that which
            happens at that time ——
        </p>
        <p>
            To perfect the ability to record at the moment
            when the consciousness is enlarged by the sympathies
            and the unity of understanding which the
            imagination gives, to practice skill in recording the
            force moving, then to know it, in the largeness of
            its proportions ——
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the presence of a
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not " fit " but a unification of experience
        </p>
        <p>
            That is, the imagination is an actual force comparable
            to electricity or steam, it is not a plaything
            but a power that has been used from the first to
            raise the understanding of —— it is, not necessary to
            resort to mystecisism —— In fact it is this which has
            kept back the knowledge I seek ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The value of the imagination to the writer consists
            in its ability to make words. Its unique power is to
            give created forms reality, actual existence
        </p>
        <p>
            This separates
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing is not a searching about in the daily
            experience for apt similies and pretty thoughts and
            images. I have experienced that to my sorrow. It
            is not a conscious recording of the day's experiences
            " freshly and with the appearance of reality " ——
            This sort of thing is seriously to the development
            of any ability in a man, it fastens him down, makes
            him a —— It destroys, makes nature an accessory to
            the particular theory he is following, it blinds him
            to his world, ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The writer of imagination would find himself
            released from observing things for the purpose of
            writing them down later. He would be there to
            enjoy, to taste, to engage the free world, not a
            world which he carries like a bag of food, always
            fearful lest he drop something or someone get more
            than he,
        </p>
        <p>
            A world detached from the necessity of recording
            it, sufficient to itself, removed from him (as it
            most certainly is) with which he has bitter and
            delicious relations and from which he is independant
            —— moving at will from one thing to another —— as
            he pleases, unbound —— complete
        </p>
        <p>
            and the unique proof of this is the work of the
            imagination not " like " anything but transfused
            with the same forces which transfuse the earth ——
            at least one small part of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nature is the hint to composition not because it
            is familiar to us and therefore the terms we apply
            to it have a least common denominator quality
            which gives them currency —— but because it possesses
            the quality of independant existance, of reality
            which we feel in ourselves. It is not opposed to art
            but apposed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I suppose Shakespeare's familiar aphorism about
            holding the mirror up to nature has done more
            harm in stabilizing the copyist tendency of the arts
            among us than ——
        </p>
        <p>
            the mistake in it (though we forget that it is not
            S. speaking but an imaginative character of his)
            is to have believed that the reflection of nature is
            nature. It is not. It is only a sham nature, a " lie ".
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course S. is the most conspicuous example
            desirable of the falseness of this very thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            He holds no mirror up to nature but with his
            imagination rivals nature's composition with his
            own.
        </p>
        <p>
            He himself become " nature " —— continuing
            " its " marvels —— if you will
        </p>
        <p>
            I am often diverted with a recital which I have
            made for myself concerning Shakespeare : he was
            a comparatively uninformed man, quite according
            to the orthodox tradition, who lived from first to
            last a life of amusing regularity and simplicity, a
            house and wife in the suburbs, delightful children,
            a girl at court (whom he really never confused with
            his writing) and a café life which gave him with
            the freshness of discovery, the information upon which
            his imagination fed. London was full of the concentrates
            of science and adventure. He saw at " The
            Mermaid " everything he knew. He was not conspicuous
            there except for his spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
            His form was presented to him by Marlow, his
            stories were the common talk of his associates or
            else some compiler set them before him. His types
            were particularly quickened with life about him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feeling the force of life, in his peculiar intelligence,
            the great dome of his head, he had no need of anything
            but writing material to relieve himself of his
            thoughts. His very lack of scientific training loosened
            his power. He was unencumbered.
        </p>
        <p>
            For S. to pretend to knowledge would have been
            ridiculous —— no escape there —— but that he possessed
            knowledge, and extraordinary knowledge, of the
            affairs which concerned him, as they concerned the
            others about him, was self-apparent to him. It was
            not apparent to the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            His actual power was PURELY of the imagination.
            Not permitted to speak as W.S., in fact peculiarly
            barred from speaking so because of his lack
            of information, learning, not being able to rival his
            fellows in scientific training or adventure and at the
            " same time being keen enough, imaginative enough,
            to know that there is no escape except in perfection,
            in excellence, in technical excellence —— his buoyancy
            of imagination raised him NOT TO COPY them,
            not to holding the mirror up to them but to equal, to
            surpass them as a creator of knowledge, as a vigorous,
            living force above their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
            His escape was not simulated but real. Hamlet
            no doubt was written about at the middle of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            He speaks authoritatively through invention,
            through characters, through design. The objects
            of his world were real to him because he could use
            them and use them with understanding to make his
            inventions ——

            The imagination is a ——

        <p>
            The vermiculations of modern criticism of S. particularly
            amuse when the attempt is made to force
            the role of a Solon upon the creator of Richard 3d.

        <p>
            So I come again to my present day gyrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it is with the other classics : their meaning and
            worth can only be studied and understood in the
            imagination —— that which begot them only can give
            them life again, re-enkindle their perfection ——
        </p>
        <p>
            useless to study by rote or scientific research ——
            Useful for certain understanding to corroborate the
            imagination ——

            Yes, Anatole was a fool when he said: It is a lie. ——
            That is it. If the actor simulates life it is a lie. But
            —— but why continue without an audience ?
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason people marvel at works of art and say :
            How in Christ's name did he do it ? —— is that they
            know nothing of the physiology of the nervous system
            and have never in their experience witnessed the
            larger processes of the imagination.

            The decay of cathedrals
            is efflorescent
            through the phenomenal
            growth of movie houses
        </p>
        <p>
            whose catholicity is
            progress since
            destruction and creation

            without sacrifice
            of even the smallest
            detail even to the
            volcanic organ whose
        </p>
        <p>
            woe is translatable
            to joy if light becomes

            light, as it will ——

            But scism which seems
            adamant is diverted
            from the perpendicular
            by simply rotating the object
        </p>
        <p>
            cleaving away the root of
            disaster which it
            seemed to foster. Thus
            the movies are a moral force

        <p>
            Nightly the crowds
            with the closeness and
            universality of sand
            witness the selfspittle
        </p>
        <p>
            which used to be drowned
            in incense and intoned
            over by the supple jointed
            imagination of inoffensiveness
        </p>
        <p>
            backed by biblical
            rigidity made into passion plays
            upon the altar to
            attract the dynamic mob
        </p>
        <p>
            whose female relative
            sweeping grass Tolstoi
            saw injected into
            the Russian nobility
        </p>
        <p>
            It is rarely understood how such plays as Shakespeare's
            were written —— or in fact how any work of
            value has been written, the practical bearing of
            which is that only as the work was produced, in that
            way alone can it be understood
        </p>
        <p>
            Fruitless for the academic tapeworm to hoard its
            excrementa is books. The cage ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The most of all writing has not even begun in the
            province from which alone it can draw sustenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is not life in the stuff because it tries to be
            " like " life.
        </p>
        <p>
            First must come the transposition of the faculties
            to the only world of reality that men know : the world
            of the imagination, wholly our own. From this
            world alone does the work gain power, its soil the
            only one whose chemistry is perfect to the purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exaltation men feel before a work of art
            is the feeling of reality they draw from it. It sets
            them up, places a value upon experience —— (said
            that half a dozen times already)

        <p>
            some doctor's family, some Elsie ——
            voluptuous water

            brain the truth about us ——

        <p>
            as if the earth under our feet
            were
            an excrement of some sky

        <p>
            the stifling heat of September

            it seems to destroy us

        <p>
            It is only in isolate flecks that
            something

        </p>
        <p>
            No one
            to witness

        </p>
        <p>
            or better : prose has to do with the fact of an
            emotion ; poetry has to do with the dynamisation
            of emotion into a separate form. This is the force of
            imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            prose : statement of facts concerning emotions,
            intellectua states, data of all sorts —— technical expositions,
            jargon, of all sorts —— fictional and other ——
        </p>
        <p>
            poetry : new form dealt with as a reality in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form of prose is the accuracy of its subject
            matter-how best to expose the multiform phases of
            its material
        </p>
        <p>
            the form of poetry is related to the movements of
            the imagination revealed in words —— or whatever
            it may be ——
        </p>
        <p>
            the cleavage is complete
        </p>
        <p>
            Why should I go further than I am able ? Is it
            not enough for you that I am perfect ?
        </p>
        <p>
            The cleavage goes through all the phases of experience.
            It is the jump from prose to the process of
            imagination that is the next great leap of the intelligence
            —— from the simulations of present experience
            to the facts of the imagination ——

            the greatest characteristic of the present age is
            that it is stale —— stale as literature ——
        </p>
        <p>
            To enter a new world, and have there freedom of
            movement and newness.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean that there will always be prose painting,
            representative work, clever as may be in revealing
            new phases of emotional research presented on the
            surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the jump from that to Cezanne or back to
            certain of the primitives is the impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primitives are not back in some remote age ——
            they are not BEHIND experience. Work which
            bridges the gap between the rigidities of vulgar experience
            and the imagination is rare. It is new, immediate ——
            It is so because it is actual, always real. It
            is experience dynamized into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Time does not move. Only ignorance and stupidity
            move. Intelligence (force, power) stands still with
            time and forces change about itself —— sifting the
            world for permanence, in the drift of nonentity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pio Baroia interested me once ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Baroja leaving the medical profession, some not
            important inspectors work in the north of Spain,
            opened a bakery in Madrid.
        </p>
        <p>
            The isolation he speaks of, as a member of the so
            called intellectual class, influenced him to abandon
            his position and engage himself, as far as possible,
            in the intricacies of the design patterned by the
            social class —— He sees no interest in isolation ——
        </p>
        <p>
            These gestures are the effort for self preservation
            or the preservation of some quality held in high
            esteem ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Here it seems to be that a man, starved in imagination,
            changes his milieu so that his food may be
            richer —— The social class, without the power of expression,
            lives upon imaginative values.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean only to emphasize the split that goes down
            through the abstractions of art to the everyday
            exercises of the most primitive types ——
        </p>
        <p>
            there is a sharp division —— the energizing force of
            imagination on one side —— and the acquisitive ——
            PROGRESSIVE force of the lump on the other
        </p>
        <p>
            The social class with its religion, its faith, sincerity
            and all the other imaginative values is positive (yes)
        </p>
        <p>
            the merchant, hibernating, unmagnatized ——
            tends to drop away into the isolate, inactive particles
            —— Religion is continued then as a form, art as a
            convention ——
        </p>
        <p>
            To the social, energized class —— ebullient now in
            Russia the particles adhere because of the force
            of the imagination energizing them ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyhow the change of Baroja interested me
        </p>
        <p>
            Among artists, or as they are sometimes called
            " men of imagination " " creators ", etc. this force
            is recognized in a pure state —— All this can be used
            to show the relationships between genius, hand labor,
            religion —— etc. and the lack of feeling between artists
            and the middle class type ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The jump between fact and the imaginative reality
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of all human activity is the deliniation
            of the cresence and ebb of this force, shifting from
            class to class and location to location —— rhythm : the
            wave rhythm of Shakespeare watching clowns and
            kings sliding into nothing

            This is the time of year
            when boys fifteen and seventeen
            wear two horned lilac blossoms
            in their caps —— or over one ear
        </p>
        <p>
            What is it that does this ?
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a certain sort ——
            drivers for grocers or taxidrivers
            white and colored ——
        </p>
        <p>
            fellows that let their hair grow long
            in a curve over one eye ——

            Horned purple

            vulgarity raised to the last power

        <p>
            They have stolen them
            broken the bushes apart
            with a curse for the owner ——

        <p>
            Lilacs ——
        </p>
        <p>
            They stand in the doorways
            on the business streets with a sneer
            on their faces

        <p>
            adorned with blossoms

            ula lu la lu

        <p>
            The blazing secrecy of noon is undone
            and and and
            the broken sand is the sound of love ——

            to the edge of the sea

        </p>
        <p>
            a wink over the shoulder
            large as the ocean ——
            with wave following wave to the edge

            The fixed categories into which life is divided must
            always hold. These things are normal —— essential to
            every activity. But they exist —— but not as dead
            dissections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The curriculum of knowledge cannot but be divided
            into the sciences, the thousand and one groups of
            data, scientific, philosophic or whatnot —— as many
            as there exist in Shakespeare —— things that make
            him appear the university of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this is not the thing. In the galvanic category
            of —— The same things exist, but in a different
            condition when energized by the imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The whole field of education is affected —— There
            is no end of detail that is without significance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Education would begin by placing in the mind of
            the student the nature of knowledge —— in the dead
            state and the nature of the force which may energize
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This would clarify his field at once —— He would
            then see the use of data
        </p>
        <p>
            But at present knowledge is placed before a man
            as if it were a stair at the top of which a DEGREE
            is obtained which is superlative.
        </p>
        <p>
            nothing could be more ridiculous. To data there
            is no end. There is proficiency in dissection and a
            knowledge of parts but in the use of knowledge ——
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the imagination that ——
        </p>
        <p>
            That is : life is absolutely simple. In any civilized
            society everyone should know EVERYTHING there
            is to know about life at once and always. There should
            never be permitted, confusion ——
        </p>
        <p>
            There are difficulties to life, under conditions there
            are impasses, life may prove impossible —— But it
            must never be lost —— as it is today ——
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember so distinctly the young Pole in Leipzig
            going with hushed breath to hear Wundt lecture ——
            In this mass of intricate philosophic data what one
            of the listeners was able to maintain himself for the
            winking of an eyelash. Not one. The inundation of
            the intelligence by masses of complicated fact is not
            knowledge. There is no end ——
        </p>
        <p>
            And what is the fourth dimension ? It is the endlessness
            of knowledge ——
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the imagination on which reality rides —— It is
            the imagination —— It is a cleavage through everything
            by a force that does not exist in the mass and
            therefore can never be discovered by its anatomitization.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is for this reason that I have always placed art
            first and esteemed it over science —— in spite of everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Art is the pure effect of the force upon which science
            depends for its reality —— Poetry
        </p>
        <p>
            The effect of this realization upon life will be the
            emplacement of knowledge into a living current ——
            which it has always sought ——
        </p>
        <p>
            In other times —— men counted it a tragedy to be
            dislocated from sense —— Today boys are sent with
            dullest faith to technical schools of all sorts —— broken,
            bruised
        </p>
        <p>
            few escape whole —— slaughter. This is not civilization
            but stupidity —— Before entering knowledge the
            integrity of the imagination ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The effect will be to give importance to the subdivisions
            of experience —— which today are absolutely
            lost —— There exists simply nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prose —— When values are important, such —— For
            example there is no use denying that prose and poetry
            are not by any means the same IN INTENTION.
            But then what is prose ? There is no need for it to
            approach poetry except to be weakened.
        </p>
        <p>
            With decent knowledge to hand we can tell what
            things are for
        </p>
        <p>
            I except to see values blossom. I expect to see
            prose be prose. Prose, relieved of extraneous, unrelated
            values must return to its only purpose : to clarity
            to enlighten the understanding. There is no form
            to prose but that which depends on clarity. If prose
            is not acurately adjusted to the exposition of fats
            it does not exist —— Its form is that alone. To penetrate
            everywhere with enlightenment ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Poetry is something quite different. Poetry has to
            do with the crystalization of the imagination —— the
            perfection of new forms as additions to nature ——
            Prose may follow to enlighten but poetry ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Is what I have written prose ? The only answer is
            that form in prose ends with the end of that which
            is being communicated —— If the power to go on falters
            in the middle of a sentence —— that is the end of the s
            entence —— Or if a new phase enters at that point it
            is only stupidity to go on.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no confusion —— only difficulties.

            The nature of the difference between what is
            termed prose on the one hand and verse on the other
            is not to be discovered by a study of the metrical
            characteristics of the words as they occur in juxtaposition.
            It is ridiculous to say that verse grades off
            into prose as the rythm becomes less and less pronounced,
            in fact, that verse differs from prose in that
            the meter is more pronounced, that the movement is
            more impassioned and that rhythmical prose, so
            called, occupies a middle place between prose and
            verse.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is true that verse is likely to be more strongly
            stressed than what is termed prose, but to say that
            this is in any way indicative of the difference in
            nature of the two is surely to make the mistake of
            arguing from the particular to the general, to the
            effect that since an object has a certain character
            that therefore the force which gave it form will
            alwavs reveal itself in that character.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course there is nothing to do but to differentiate
            prose from verse by the only effective means at hand,
            the external, surface appearance. But a counter proposal
            may be made, to wit : that verse is of such a
            nature that it may appear without metrical stress
            of any sort and that prose may be strongly stressed
            —— in short that meter has nothing to do with the
            question whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it may be said that if the difference is
            felt and is not discoverable to the eve and ear then
            what about it anyway ? Or it may be argued, that
            since there is according to my proposal no discoverable
            difference between prose and verse that in all
            probability none exists and that both are phases of
            the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, quite plainly, there is a very marked difference
            between the two which may arise in the
            fact of a separate origin for each, each using similar
            modes for dis-similar purposes ; verse falling most
            commonly into meter but not always, and prose
            going forward most often without meter but not
            alwavs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This at least serves to explain some of the best
            work I see today and explains some of the most
            noteworthy failures which I discover. I search for
            " something " in the writing which moves me in a
            certain way —— It offers a suggestion as to why some
            work of Whitman's is bad poetry and some, in the
            same meter is prose.
        </p>
        <p>
            The practical point would be to discover when a
            work is to be taken as coming from this source
            and when from that. When discovering a work it
            would be —— If it is poetry it means this and only
            this —— and if it is prose it means that and only
            that. Anything else is a confusion, silly and bad
            practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe this is possible as I believe in the main
            that Marianne Moore is of all American writers most
            constantly a poet —— not because her lines are invarjably
            full of imagery they are not, they are often
            diagramatically informative, and not because she
            clips her work into certain shapes —— her pieces
            are without meter most often —— but I believe she
            is most constantly a poet in her work because
            the purpose of her work is invariably from the
            source from which poetry starts —— that it is constantly
            from the purpose of poetry. And that it
            actually possesses this characteristic, as of that
            origin, to a more distinguishable degree when it
            eschews verse rhythms than when it does not. It has
            the purpose of poetry written into and therefore it
            is poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe it possible, even essential, that when
            poetry fails it does not become prose but bad poetry.
            The test of Mariane Moore would be that she writes
            sometimes good and sometimes bad poetry but
            always —— with a single purpose out of a single fountain
            which is of the sort ——
        </p>
        <p>
            The practical point would be to discover ——
        </p>
        <p>
            I can go no further than to say that poetry feeds
            the imagination and prose the emotions, poetry
            liberates the words from their emotional implications,
            prose confirms them in it. Both move centrifugally
            or centripetally toward the intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course it must be understood that writing
            deals with words and words only and that all discussions
            of it deal with single words and their association
            in groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as I can discover there is no way but the
            one I have marked out which will satisfactorily deal
            with certain lines such as occur in some play of
            Shakespeare or in a poem of Marianne Moore's, let us
            say : Tomorrow will be the first of April ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Certainly there is an emotional content in this for
            anyone living in the northern temperate zone, but
            whether it is prose or poetry —— taken by itself ——
            who is going to say unless some mark is put on
            it by the intent conveved by the words which
            surround it ——
        </p>
        <p>
            Either to write or to comprehend poetry the
            words must be recognized to be moving in a direction
            separate from the jostling or lack of it which occurs
            within the piece.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marianne's words remain separate, each unwilling
            to group with the others except as they move in the
            one direction. This is even an important —— or amusing
            —— character of Miss Moore's work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her work puzzles me. It is not easy to quote
            convincingly.

        <p>
            The imagination uses the phraseology of science.
            It attacks, stirs, animates, is radio-active in all that
            can be touched by action. Words occur in liberation
            by virtue of its processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In description words adhere to certain objects.
            and have the effect on the sense of oysters, or
            barnacles.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the imagination is wrongly understood when
            it is supposed to be a removal from reality in the
            sense of John of Gaunt's speech in Richard the
            Second : to imagine possession of that which is lost.
            It is rightly understood when John of Gaunt's
            words are related not to their sense as objects
            adherent to his son's welfare or otherwise but
            as a dance over the body of his condition accurately
            accompanying it. By this means of the understanding,
            the play written to be understood as a play,
            the author and reader are liberated to pirouette
            with the words which have sprung from the old facts
            of history, reunited in present passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand the words as so liberated is to
            understand poetry. That they move independantly
            when set free is the mark of their value
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagination is not to avoid reality, nor is it description
            nor an evocation of objects or situations, it is to
            say that poetry does not tamper with the world but
            moves it —— It affirms reality most powerfully and
            therefore, since reality needs no personal support but
            exists free from human action, as proven by science
            in the indestructibility of matter and of force, it
            creates a new object, a play, a dance which is not a
            mirror up to nature but ——
        </p>
        <p>
            As birds' wings beat the solid air without which
            none could fly so words freed by the imagination
            affirm reality by their flight
            Writing is likened to music. The object would be
            it seems to make poetry a pure art, like music.
            Painting too. Writing, as with certain of the modern
            Russians whose work I have seen, would use unoriented
            sounds in place of conventional words. The
            poem then would be completely liberated when
            there is identity of sound with something —— perhaps
            the emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not believe that writing is music. I do not
            believe writing would gain in quality or force by
            seeking to attain to the conditions of music.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the conditions of music are objects for the
            action of the writer's imagination just as a table
            or ——
        </p>
        <p>
            According to my present theme the writer of
            imagination would attain closest to the conditions
            of music not when his words are disassociated from
            natural objects and specified meanings but when
            they are liberated from the usual quality of that
            meaning by transposition into another medium,
            the imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I speak of imagination as a force,
            an electricity or a medium, a place. It is immaterial
            which : for whether it is the condition of a place or
            a dynamization its effect is the same : to free the
            world of fact from the impositions of " art " (see
            Hartley's last chapter) and to liberate the man to
            act in whatever direction his disposition leads.
        </p>
        <p>
            The word is not liberated, therefore able to
            communicate release from the fixities which destroy
            it until it is accurately tuned to the fact which giving
            it reality, by its own reality establishes its own
            freedom from the necessity of a word, thus freeing
            it and dynamizing it at the same time.
